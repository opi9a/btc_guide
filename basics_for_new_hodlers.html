<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">THE BITCOIN SYSTEM -
ITS ALL ABOUT TRANSACTIONS</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Bitcoin consists of
a public ledger or database of transactions - known as the
&quot;blockchain&quot; because transactions are grouped into blocks
when they are validated and added to the ledger.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Bitcoins exist only
by their association with transactions.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">For example, every
block that is added to the blockchain creates new bitcoins (currently
6.25), and it does this with a transaction sending 6.25 btc from
nowhere to whoever successfully created the block.  The recipient now
owns those 6.25 bitcoin.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Subsequent
transactions refer back to previous transactions. For example if the
recipient of the 6.25 bitcoin above wanted to send 3 bitcoin to
someone else, they would make a new transaction referring to the
previous one in which they received the 6.25 bitcoin.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">So, owning bitcoins
means being a recipient of a bitcoin transaction.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">ADDRESSES DEFINE THE
RECIPIENTS OF A TRANSACTIONS</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">A transaction needs
something to define where (or who) it's going to.  Just like a cheque
needs a recipient name, or a bank transfer needs a destination
account. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">In bitcoin this is
defined by an &quot;address&quot; - a long-ish string of letters and
digits (which actually just represent a very large number). 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">An example of a
bitcoin address is:  3QjKms5ox5Df6poH7s1bBzrVKaMkvoHyGV</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">All bitcoin
transactions have a receiving address.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Your wallet software
will allow you to generate addresses that you can give to people who
are sending you bitcoin. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">For example, when
withdrawing from an exchange you will probably paste an address from
your wallet into the exchange's web page or app. Funds sent to that
address will show up in your wallet.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Similar to a bank
account number, the address defines who owns the bitcoin - but you
need more than just the number to control the funds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Unlike a bank
account number, you normally use a different address for each
transaction you receive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">PRIVATE KEYS</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">When bitcoin is
moved in a transaction, you also need some way of verifying that this
is with the consent of the owner.  Otherwise everyone could steal
everyone's bitcoin.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">In bitcoin
transactions are verified by a digital signature.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">This is similar to
the signature on a cheque, or a password on a banking app - but a bit
more complicated because you can't just add the same signature or
password to each transaction.  All transactions are public, and its
important that they can be validated by everybody - so a simple
signature or password would just be copied and used to steal all the
rest of your bitcoin.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Instead a system is
used where each receiving address is associated with a secret
&quot;private key&quot; which can generate a unique digital signature
when a transaction is made using bitcoin from that address.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Everyone can check
the signature is valid, and could only be generated using the private
key associated with the address - but nobody can actually work out
what the private key is, or use the signature to do anything else.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Private keys are
very sensitive.  If anyone has access to the private key associated
with addresses in your wallet then they can steal any bitcoin
associated with those addresses.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Hardware wallets
like Trezor are designed to generate and store private keys and use
them to sign transactions in a very secure way.  You will never
normally see a private key (though they are also just large numbers
represented by letters and digits).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">SEED WORDS</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">If your wallet has
received 5 transactions, this means that each of 5 addresses in the
wallet will be associated with some quantity of bitcoin - and there
will be 5 corresponding private keys, one for each. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">In the early days of
bitcoin this was all you got. A wallet had lists of potentially large
numbers of separate addresses and private keys, and that's all there
was to it.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">There's nothing
wrong with this in principle, but it leads to some practical
difficulties which actually pose big security problems. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">For example if you
want to make a back up of your wallet (in case the computer it's
stored on breaks) then you have to copy the whole thing - all the
addresses and private keys.  You are really just limited to doing
this with a computer - as there is so much information, and a single
error could be catastrophic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">This is bad because
computers can be compromised, particularly if they connect to the
internet.  It would be much better to be able to make inert physical
backups, like on a piece of paper - which you could be sure no hacker
could ever get to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The need for a
simple way to back up an entire wallet led to the modern invention of
&quot;seed words&quot; or &quot;mnemonic seeds&quot;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">In this system, each
wallet begins by generating a large random number - which can be
represented by a series of 12 (sometimes 24) words.  It's easy for
the user to write this sequence of words down, or ever memorise it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Then the wallet uses
clever maths to generate a series (essentially infinite) of addresses
and corresponding private keys.  These can be used normally, as shown
above.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">But the important
thing is: the way these addresses and keys are generated is
completely reproducible.  That means that all you need is the 12
words, and you can always use those to regenerate your whole wallet. 
Most wallet programs use the same convention, and the maths used is
all published, so a wallet can be fully recovered even if the
particular software or device you used originally no longer exists.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">STORING SEED WORDS</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">As a user of a
hardware wallet - or any wallet with significant funds - the most
important task by far is looking after your seed words.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">This guide won't
give specific advice on how to do that - it's dependent on your
circumstances and preferences.  But here are some approaches that
have been used by other people as part of their security strategy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Overall it's worth
noting that there are two threats to worry about:  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">  - the risk of LOSS
of your seed words, so that you cannot recover your funds;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">  - the risk of
THEFT of your seed words, so that someone else recovers and steals
your funds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">These threats are
usually in opposition, in the sense that a strategy which reduces
risk of loss (such as having multiple copies) will often increase the
risk of theft.  Striking a balance between these is up to you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Paper wallets:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The most basic level
of security is to copy down your seed words on a bit of paper, and
take care of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Multiple paper
copies:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">An obvious way to
mitigate the risk of loss is to make multiple copies of your seed,
kept in different locations.  However this will likely increase the
risk of theft - so you'd probably only want to do this if you had a
few very secure locations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Durable storage
media:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Paper is obviously
susceptible to fire and flood, so some people like to record their
seed words on something more durable.  Home-made solutions are
obviously possible involving steel plates and punches, but kits
specifically designed for the purpose are also available.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Note that the words
that form the seed are deliberately designed to be uniquely defined
by their first 4 letters.  So if GRUEL is in the word list, it means
there are no other words beginning grue (and gruesome will NOT be in
the list).  That means you only need to record the first 4 letters of
each word, which can reduce the difficulty of this approach a lot.</p>
