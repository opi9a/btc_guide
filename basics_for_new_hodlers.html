But under the hood they will all be doing <span class="T16">pretty much </span>what is described here.</p><p class="P12">It is important to recognize that in taking this step, you are <span class="T16">personally</span> responsible for anything that happens. If you make a mistake there is ultimately no recourse or compensation – you can lose all your funds and plenty have.</p><p class="P11">That’s a good reason to take things cautiously. Read and consider this guide. Look for other information on the internet – but always be sceptical, there are many scammers out there. Decide on an approach <span class="T15">you’re happy with before you jump in and move your coins</span>. You can also use small test amounts of bitcoin to begin with. Only proceed when you are confident.</p><p class="P6">But the good news is, with a little consideration and learning everyone can take full responsibility and control over their own wealth. That’s <span class="T17">why</span> we bitcoin!!</p><p class="P18">T<span class="T18">his guide aims to do explain:</span></p><ul><li><p class="P27" style="margin-left:0.9cm;"><span class="Bullet_20_Symbols" style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">•</span><span class="T8">how </span><span class="T9">your wallet</span><span class="T8"> allows you to receive and send bitcoins, </span><span class="T9">so you can have more confidence in using it.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li><li><p class="P27" style="margin-left:0.9cm;"><span class="Bullet_20_Symbols" style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0.635cm;">•</span><span class="T8">how you can make and securely store backups of your wallet </span><span class="T9">using the all-important </span><span class="T10">seed words</span><span class="T8">, so that you are not at risk of losing bitcoin.</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ul><p class="P18"> </p><p class="P3">BITCOIN <span class="T1">IS</span> ALL ABOUT TRANSACTIONS</p><p class="P21"><span class="T7">Bitcoin consists of a public ledger or database of transactions.  </span><span class="T8">This ledger is</span><span class="T7"> known as the "blockchain" because transactions are grouped into blocks when they are validated and added to </span><span class="T8">it</span><span class="T7">.  </span><span class="T8">You can see the bitcoin blockchain for yourself on a “block explorer” like </span><a href="https://www.smartbit.com.au/" class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T8">this</span></a><span class="T8">.</span></p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">Bitcoins exist only by their association with transactions.  For example, every <span class="T1">new </span>block that is added to the blockchain creates new bitcoins (currently 6.25), and it does this with a transaction sending 6.25 btc <span class="T1">(</span>from nowhere!<span class="T1">)</span> to whoever created the block. The recipient <span class="T1">of that transaction </span>now owns those 6.25 bitcoin.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">Subsequent transactions refer back to previous transactions. For example if the recipient of the 6.25 bitcoin above wanted to send 3 bitcoin to someone else, they would make a new transaction referring to the one in which they received the 6.25 bitcoin.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P15">So <span class="T2">owning bitcoin means being a recipient of bitcoin transaction</span><span class="T3">s</span>.  <span class="T1">The next section explains how your wallet allows you to receive transactions by generating “addresses” to which bitcoin can be sent.</span></p><p class="P15"> </p><p class="P15"><span class="T16">And </span><span class="T3">spending bitcoin means creating bitcoin transactions that are sent to someone else</span><span class="T1">.  As explained below, your wallet does this too, by using “private keys” to digitally sign outbound transactions.</span></p><p class="P15"> </p><p class="P15"> </p><p class="Heading_20_1">ADDRESSES DEFINE THE RECIPIENTS OF TRANSACTIONS</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">A transaction needs something to define where (or who) it's going to. Just like a cheque needs a recipient name, or a bank transfer needs a destination account.  In bitcoin this is defined by an "address" - a long-ish string of letters and digits (which actually just represent a very large number). </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">An example of a bitcoin address is: 3QjKms5ox5Df6poH7s1bBzrVKaMkvoHyGV</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">All bitcoin transactions have a receiving address.  Your wallet software will allow you to generate <span class="T1">receiving </span>addresses <span class="T1">like the one above</span> that you can give to people who are sending you bitcoin. </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">For example, when withdrawing from an exchange you will probably paste an address <span class="T1">from</span> your wallet into the exchange's web page or app.  <span class="T18">Bitcoin</span> sent to that address will show up in your wallet.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">Similar to a bank account number, the address defines who owns the bitcoin - but you need more than just the number to control the funds.  Unlike a bank account number, you normally use a different address for each transaction you receive.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P1">PRIVATE KEYS <span class="T1">ARE USED TO SIGN TRANSACTIONS AND SEND BITCOIN</span></p><p class="P14">When bitcoin is moved in a transaction, <span class="T18">there </span>need<span class="T18">s to be</span> some way of verifying that this is <span class="T19">the intention of</span> the owner. Otherwise everyone could steal everyone <span class="T1">else</span>'s bitcoin <span class="T1">by just making transactions sending it to themselves</span>.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14"><span class="T1">B</span>itcoin transactions are verified by a <span class="T2">digital signature</span>.  This is similar to the signature on a cheque, or a password on a banking app - but a bit more complicated because you can't just add <span class="T1">your</span> signature or password to each transaction. All transactions are public, and its important that they can be validated by everybody - so a simple signature or password would just be copied and used to steal all the rest of your bitcoin.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">Instead a system is used where each receiving address is associated with a secret "private key" which can <span class="T1">be used to </span>generate a unique digital signature when a transaction is made using bitcoin from that address. </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">Everyone can check the signature is valid, and could only be generated using the private key associated with the address - but nobody can actually work out what the private key is, or use the signature to do anything <span class="T1">malicious</span>.  <span class="T1">This cryptomagic is used for basically all internet security – it’s known as “public key cryptography”.</span></p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14"><span class="T2">Private keys are very sensitive</span>. If anyone has access to the private key associated with <span class="T1">an </span>address in your wallet then they can steal any bitcoin associated with <span class="T1">that</span> address.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">Hardware wallets like Trezor are designed to generate and store private keys and use them to sign transactions in a very secure way. You will never normally see a private key (though they are also just large numbers represented by letters and digits).</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="Heading_20_1">SEED WORDS</p><p class="P14">If your wallet has received 5 transactions, this means that each of 5 addresses in the wallet will be associated with some quantity of bitcoin - and there will be 5 corresponding private keys, one for each. </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P15">In the early days of bitcoin this was all you got. A wallet had <span class="T1">potentially very long </span>lists of addresses and private keys, and that's all there was to it. </p><p class="P15"> </p><p class="P15"><span class="T1">T</span>here's nothing wrong with this in principle, but it leads to some practical difficulties which actually pose big security problems.  For example if you want to make a back up of your wallet (in case the computer it's stored on breaks) then you have to copy the whole thing - all the addresses and private keys. You <span class="T1">can only really do</span> this with a computer - as there is so much information, and a single error could be catastrophic.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">This is bad because computers can be compromised, particularly if they connect to the internet. It would be much better to be able to make <span class="T1">dumb</span> physical backups, like on a piece of paper - which you could be sure no <span class="T1">internet </span>hacker could ever get to.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">The need for a simple way to back up an entire wallet led to the invention of <span class="T1">the modern system of </span>"seed words" or "mnemonic seeds".</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">In this system, each <span class="T1">new </span>wallet begins by generating a large random number - which can be represented by a series of 12 (<span class="T1">in some wallets</span> 24) words. It's easy for the user to write this sequence of words down, or eve<span class="T1">n</span> memorise it.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">Then the wallet uses clever maths to generate a series (essentially infinite) of addresses and corresponding private keys. These can be used normally, as shown above, <span class="T1">to receive and send bitcoin</span>.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">But the important thing is: <span class="T2">the way these addresses and keys are generated is completely reproducible</span>. That means that all you need is the 12 words, and you can always use those to regenerate your whole wallet. Most wallet programs use the same convention <span class="T1">for doing this</span>, and the maths used is all published, so a wallet can be recovered even if the particular software or device you used originally no longer exists.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="Heading_20_1">STORING SEED WORDS</p><p class="P14">As a user of a hardware wallet - or any wallet with significant funds - the most important task by far is looking after your seed words. </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P22">This guide won't give specific advice on what to do with your seed words. As you’ll see it's dependent on your circumstances and preferences - and these decisions are an important part of taking control for yourself. But this section explains some approaches that could be used in building a security strategy. You can use them in whatever combination you decide – or do something completely different.</p><p class="P22"> </p><p class="P14"><span class="T1">First</span> it's worth noting that there are two <span class="T1">types of</span> threat to worry about: </p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">- the risk of <span class="T4">LOSS</span> of your seed words, so that you cannot recover your funds;</p><p class="P14">- the risk of <span class="T4">THEFT</span> of your seed words, so that someone else recovers and steals your funds.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">These threats are usually in opposition, in the sense that <span class="T1">something </span>which reduces risk of loss (such as having multiple copies) will often increase the risk of theft – <span class="T1">and vice versa</span>. </p><p class="P19"> </p><p class="P15"><span class="T1">It’s worth taking time to mull all this over, and not act in a rush.  A good general rule is to err on the side of simplicity:  of the two threats above,</span><span class="T6"> </span><span class="T5">loss of funds because you fuck something up is much more probable than theft</span><span class="T1">.</span></p><p class="P15"> </p><p class="P16">Finally it’s good security practice not to tell people unnecessarily how you are storing your bitcoin – or indeed that you have any in the first place.  People have been targeted for physical attacks, and while it’s possible to use the strategies below to protect your bitcoin in these circumstances, it’s much better not to have to <span class="T13">rely on them</span>!  However it is worth considering who in your family or whatever needs to know how to access your bitcoin if something happened to you.</p><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__Simple_paper_storage"><span/></a><span class="T1">Simple p</span>aper <span class="T1">storage</span></h2><p class="P14">The most basic level of security is to copy down your seed words on a bit of paper, and <span class="T1">put it somewhere safe</span>.  <span class="T1">Use pen that won’t run.  Maybe put it in a polythene sleeve or bag.</span></p><p class="P14"> </p><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__Additional_copies"><span/></a><span class="T11">Additional</span> copies</h2><p class="P15">An obvious way to mitigate the risk of loss is to make multiple copies of your seed, kept in different locations.  However this will likely increase the risk of theft - so you'd <span class="T11">want each location to be very secure</span>.</p><p class="P15"> </p><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__Multiple_wallets"><span/></a>Multiple wallets</h2><p class="P4">One way to mitigate lots of risks is to <span class="T12">put your eggs in more than one basket and </span>simply use multiple wallets – ideally using somewhat different approaches, or storing things in different places.  This means that if something bad happens, or you have a brain fart and screw something up, the amount of damage you can do is limited to the fraction of funds you have in the wallet(s) affected.</p><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__Durable_storage_media"><span/></a>Durable storage media</h2><p class="P15">Paper is obviously susceptible to fire and flood, so some people like to record their seed words on something more durable, <span class="T1">particularly metal</span>.  Home-made solutions are obviously possible involving steel plates and punches, but kits specifically designed for the purpose are also available.</p><p class="P14"> </p><p class="P14">Note that the words that form the seed are deliberately designed to be uniquely defined by their first 4 letters. So if GRUEL is in the word list, it means there are no other words beginning grue (and gruesome will NOT be in the list). That means you only need to record the first 4 letters of each word, which can reduce the difficulty of this approach a lot.</p><p class="P20"><span class="T8">Some good info and reviews of available products </span><a href="https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/" class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T8">here</span></a>.</p><p class="P20"> </p><h2 class="P24"><a id="a__Splitting_seeds"><span/></a>Splitting seeds</h2><p class="P8">Storing a set of seed words always carries the risk that someone could find it and empty the wallet they are associated with.  One possible approach to reducing this threat is to split seeds up into multiple parts for storage in different locations.</p><p class="P8">If doing this it’s important to be aware that if an attacker knows, say, 8 of the 12 words they will probably be able to “brute force” the other 4 – just by trying all possible combinations of words.  It’s possible they could do this with 6 words.  It’s pretty unlikely, in my view they could do it with 8.  <span class="T12">Problems of brute-forcing partial seeds are less severe with 24 word seeds.</span></p><p class="P8">Also you need to be sure that you don’t create additional vulnerabilities – for example if you just split your seed into 3 parts, loss of any part will mean you lose access to the wallet (unless you can brute force it!).  <span class="T12">Overlapping partial seeds are another possibility.</span></p><p class="P9">If using any of these approaches you need to be sure you can remember what you’ve done, what’s stored where etc.</p><p class="P14"> </p><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__Added_passphrase"><span/></a>Added passphrase</h2><p class="P4">This is probably the most effective additional security you can use – and recommended for large amounts of bitcoin.  However it entails an additional layer of complexity, and is not to be taken lightly.</p><p class="P4">The system for generating a wallet based on 12 <span class="T12">or 24</span> seed words described above also permits you to add further characters of your own choice – up to 50 in most wallet applications.  If you do this, the wallet created will be entirely different, with a completely separate set of addresses and private keys.  </p><p class="P4">An additional “passphrase” such as this is not usually stored on your wallet application or device.  You will usually enter it yourself each time you open the wallet.  A hardware wallet with a given seed can therefore be used as the base for an unlimited number of different wallets – each defined by a different passphrase.  </p><p class="P5"><span class="T14">The big</span> advantage of <span class="T14">this approach</span> <span class="T14">is that, t</span>o steal your bitcoin, any attacker needs your <span class="T14">s</span>eed <span class="T14">words </span>AND your passphrase.  Either alone is useless – as long as the passphrase is long enough that it cannot be guessed.  <span class="T14">It therefore</span> allows strategies where you <span class="T14">can</span> split the information required to recover your wallet – so that an attacker who finds one part cannot do anything.  It also means that even if an attacker was able to extract the <span class="T14">seed</span> words from your device somehow <span class="T14">(very unlikely but not inconceivable)</span>, they would not be able to access any wallets protected by a passphrase.</p><p class="P4">If using a passphrase it’s important to be clear exactly what your strategy is.</p><p class="P4">For example in a high security strategy the passphrase should be kept separate from the seed words - but then you need to be certain that you will be able to recover them both yourself.  Some sort of documentation of this is probably a good idea – and obviously you need to be careful to keep the documentation itself safe!</p><p class="P4">Depending on your strategy you probably also need to be confident that the passphrase is genuinely random, and long enough that an attacker could not “brute force” guess it.  </p><p class="P7"><span class="T1">There’s a good explanation of passphrases (as used on the Trezor) </span><a href="https://blog.trezor.io/passphrase-the-ultimate-protection-for-your-accounts-3a311990925b" class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T1">here</span></a>.</p><h2 class="Heading_20_2"><a id="a__Memorisation"><span/></a>Memorisation</h2><p class="P4">The “mnemonic” seed word system was partly designed to enable relatively easy memorization of seeds.  It’s probably not a good idea to rely on this alone, but it can be a handy back-up, as well as allowing you to potentially cross hostile borders carrying $billions.</p><p class="P7"><span class="T1">Be aware that memorizing your seed may leave you vulnerable to the classic </span><a href="https://xkcd.com/538/" class="Internet_20_link"><span class="T1">$5 wrench attack.</span></a></p><h2 class="P23"><a id="a__Safety_deposit_boxes"><span/></a>Safety deposit boxes</h2><p class="P4">These can be a good option for storing copies of seeds.  Used in combination with passphrases they can result in very secure strategies.  </p><p class="P10">Safety deposit facilities will usually only allow registered users to enter <span class="T19">alone </span>– so they give good protection against physical coercion.  They <span class="T19">also </span>can be useful for inheritance planning as they will have well-defined procedures for giving access to executors of your estate, usually on production of a death certificate or similar proof.</p><h2 class="P25"><a id="a__Multi-signature_wallets"><span/></a>Multi-signature wallets</h2><p class="P17">Bitcoin allows you to create wallets where transactions require combinations of independent signatures to be valid.  For example you can specify, in effect 3 different seeds, of which 2 signatures are required.</p><p class="P17"> </p><p class="P17">This functionality is still for advanced users – and while it’s potentially extremely secure, if you are competent to use it the<span class="T19">n</span> you probably aren’t using this guide.</p><p class="P17"> </p><h2 class="P26"><a id="a__Wiping_your_hardware_device"><span/></a>Wiping your hardware device</h2><p class="P13">Every now and then an esoteric vulnerability is found in a hardware wallet (<a href="http://johoe.mooo.com/trezor-power-analysis/" class="Internet_20_link">example</a>).  They usually involves extracting the seed stored in the device.  </p><p class="P13">As described above, such attacks can usually be prevented by adding a passphrase to your seed words.  But a simpler solution if you do not regularly use your device for transactions would simply be to wipe it – and rely on restoring it from seed when you need it.</p><p class="P13">Obviously this means you need to be absolutely confident of your seed storage.  Arguably you should be anyway, but you can look at the device as a backup of the seed words themselves.  So an alternative approach might simply be to hide it very well.</p><p class="P17"> </p><p class="P17"><span class="T19">Donations:  </span>bc1qs7rq26rp3zwc63nvq9jctr8eqh73a3jt6vwadp</p><p class="P15"> </p></body></html>
