To Bitcoin</b></font></font></p>
<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p class="western">This guide is aimed at people taking their first
steps in managing bitcoin in a wallet that they control themselves. 
It is a general explanation of relevant aspects of how bitcoin works
that applies to all wallets – including hardware devices such as
Trezor and Coldcard, as well as software-only wallets such as
Electrum, Samourai, Mycelium or GreenWallet.  
</p>
<p class="western">Different wallets may have their own ways of doing
things in the user interface – for example using PINs to unlock
devices. But under the hood they will all be doing pretty much what
is described here.</p>
<p class="western"><b>It is important to recognize that in taking
this step, you are personally responsible for anything that happens.
If you make a mistake there is ultimately no recourse or compensation
– you can lose all your funds and plenty have.</b></p>
<p class="western">That’s a good reason to take things cautiously.
Read and consider this guide. Look for other information on the
internet – but always be sceptical, there are many scammers out
there. Decide on an approach you’re happy with before you jump in
and move your coins. You can also use small test amounts of bitcoin
to begin with. Only proceed when you are confident.</p>
<p class="western">But the good news is, with a little consideration
and learning everyone can take full responsibility and control over
their own wealth. That’s why we bitcoin!!</p>
<p class="western">This guide aims to explain:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="hanging-indent">how your wallet allows you to receive
	and send bitcoins, so you can have more confidence in using it.</p>
	<li><p class="hanging-indent">how you can make and securely store
	backups of your wallet using the all-important seed words, so that
	you are not at risk of losing bitcoin.</p>
</ul>
<p class="western"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western">Bitcoin is all about transactions</h1>
<p class="western">The bitcoin system consists of a public ledger or
database of transactions.  This ledger is known as the &quot;blockchain&quot;
because transactions are grouped into blocks when they are validated
and added to it.  You can see the bitcoin blockchain for yourself on
a “block explorer” like <a href="https://www.smartbit.com.au/">this</a>.</p>
<p class="western">Bitcoins exist as amounts sent in transactions. 
</p>
<p class="western">For example, every new block that is added to the
blockchain creates new bitcoins (currently 6.25), and it does this
with a transaction sending 6.25 btc (from nowhere!) to whoever
created the block. The recipient of that transaction now owns those
6.25 bitcoin.</p>
<p class="western">Subsequent transactions refer back to previous
transactions. For example if the recipient of the 6.25 bitcoin above
w&shy;anted to send 3 bitcoin to someone else, their wallet would
make a new transaction referring to the one in which they received
the 6.25 bitcoin.</p>
<p class="western">So <u>owning bitcoin means being a recipient of
bitcoin transactions</u>.  The next section explains how your wallet
allows you to receive transactions by generating “addresses” to
which bitcoin can be sent.</p>
<p class="western">And <u>spending bitcoin means creating bitcoin
transactions that are sent to someone else</u>.  As explained below,
your wallet does this too, by using “private keys” to digitally
sign outbound transactions.</p>
<h1 class="western">Addresses define the recipients of transactions</h1>
<p class="western">A transaction needs something to define where (or
who) it's going to. Just like a cheque needs a recipient name, or a
bank transfer needs a destination account.  In bitcoin this is
defined by an &quot;address&quot; - a long-ish string of letters and
digits (which actually just represent a very large number). 
</p>
<p class="western">An example of a bitcoin address is:</p>
<blockquote><font face="DejaVu Sans Mono, monospace">3QjKms5ox5Df6poH7s1bBzrVKaMkvoHyGV</font></blockquote>
<p class="western">All bitcoin transactions have a receiving address.
 Your wallet software will allow you to generate receiving addresses
like the one above that you can give to people who are sending you
bitcoin. 
</p>
<p class="western">For example, when withdrawing from an exchange you
will probably paste an address from your wallet into the exchange's
web page or app.  Bitcoin sent to that address will show up in your
wallet.</p>
<p class="western">Similar to a bank account number, the address
defines who owns the bitcoin,  but you need more than just the number
to control the funds.  Unlike a bank account number, you normally use
a different address for each transaction you receive.</p>
<p class="western">One of the main ways bitcoin has been stolen from
people is with malware which <font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">compromises</font>
your clipboard when pasting addresses – so that you end up sending
bitcoin to the hacker.  So it is extremely important to <b>always
double check all addresses that you use</b><span style="font-weight: normal">.
 Hardware wallets will allow you to do this on the device itself, so
you can be sure that no malware is interfering.</span></p>
<h1 class="western">Private keys are used to sign transactions and
send bitcoin</h1>
<p class="western">When bitcoin is moved in a transaction, there
needs to be some way of verifying that this is the intention of the
owner. Otherwise everyone could steal everyone else's bitcoin by just
making transactions sending it to themselves.</p>
<p class="western">Bitcoin transactions are verified by a <u>digital
signature</u>.  This is similar to the signature on a cheque, or a
password on a banking app - but a bit more complicated because you
can't just add your signature or password to each bitcoin
transaction. All bitcoin transactions are public, and its important
that they can be validated by everybody - so a simple signature or
password would just be copied and used to steal all the rest of your
bitcoin.</p>
<p class="western">Instead a system is used where each receiving
address is associated with a secret &quot;private key&quot; which can
be used to generate a unique digital signature when a transaction is
made using bitcoin from that address. 
</p>
<p class="western">Everyone can check the signature is valid, and
could only be generated using the private key associated with the
address - but nobody can actually work out what the private key is,
or use the signature to do anything malicious.  This cryptomagic is
used for basically all internet security – it’s known as “public
key cryptography”.</p>
<p class="western"><u>Private keys are very sensitive</u>. If anyone
has access to the private key associated with an address in your
wallet then they can steal any bitcoin associated with that address.</p>
<p class="western">Hardware wallets like Trezor are designed to
generate and store private keys and use them to sign transactions in
a very secure way. You will never normally see a private key (though
they are also just large numbers represented by letters and digits).</p>
<h1 class="western">Seed Words</h1>
<p class="western">If your wallet has received 5 transactions, this
means that each of 5 addresses in the wallet will be associated with
some quantity of bitcoin - and there will be 5 corresponding private
keys, one for each. 
</p>
<p class="western">In the early days of bitcoin this was all you got.
A wallet had potentially very long lists of addresses and private
keys, and that's all there was to it. 
</p>
<p class="western">There's nothing wrong with this in principle, but
it leads to some practical difficulties which actually pose big
security problems.  For example if you want to make a back-up of your
wallet (in case the computer it's stored on breaks) then you have to
copy the whole thing - all the addresses and private keys. You can
only really do this with a computer - as there is so much
information, and a single error could be catastrophic.</p>
<p class="western">This is bad because computers can be compromised,
particularly if they connect to the internet. It would be much better
to be able to make dumb physical backups, like on a piece of paper -
which you could be sure no internet hacker could ever get to.</p>
<p class="western">The need for a simple way to back up an entire
wallet led to the invention of the modern system of &quot;seed words&quot;
or &quot;mnemonic seeds&quot;.</p>
<p class="western">In this system, each new wallet begins by
generating a large random number - which can be represented by a
sequence of 12 (in some wallets 24) words. It's easy for the user to
write this sequence of words down, or even memorize it.</p>
<p class="western">Then the wallet uses clever math to generate a
series (essentially infinite) of addresses and corresponding private
keys. These can be used normally, as shown above, to receive and send
bitcoin.</p>
<p class="western">But the important thing is: the way these
addresses and keys are generated from the seed words is completely
reproducible. That means that all you need is the seed words, and you
can always use those to reproduce your whole wallet – all the
addresses and private keys you ever used.  
</p>
<p class="western">Most wallet programs use the same convention for
doing this, and the math used is all published, so a wallet can be
recovered even if the particular software or device you used
originally no longer exists.</p>
<h1 class="western">Storing seed words</h1>
<p class="western">As a user of a hardware wallet - or any wallet
with significant funds - the most important task by far is looking
after your seed words. 
</p>
<p class="western">This guide won't give specific advice on what to
do with your seed words. As you’ll see it's dependent on your
circumstances and preferences - and making these decisions is an
important part of taking control for yourself. But this section
explains some approaches that could be used in building a security
strategy. You can use them in whatever combination you decide – or
do something completely different.  All at your own risk, of course!</p>
<p class="western">First it's worth noting that there are two types
of threat to worry about: 
</p>
<p class="bullet-list">- the risk of LOSS of your seed words, so that
you cannot recover your funds;</p>
<p class="bullet-list">- the risk of THEFT of your seed words, so
that someone else recovers and steals your funds.</p>
<p class="bullet-list"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western">These threats are usually in opposition, in the
sense that something which reduces risk of loss (such as having
multiple copies) will often increase the risk of theft – and vice
versa. 
</p>
<p class="western">It’s worth taking time to mull all this over,
and not act in a rush.  <b>A</b><b>n important</b><b> general rule is
to </b><span style="text-decoration: none"><b>err on the side of
simplicity</b></span><span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">.</span></span>
 Of the two threats above, loss of funds because you fuck something
up is much more probable than theft.  And do not underestimate how
easy it is to forget what you have done – so either keep it simple
or make sure you have documented your strategy well (and take care to
keep the documentation safe too!).</p>
<p class="western">Finally it’s good security practice not to tell
people unnecessarily how you are storing your bitcoin – or indeed
that you have any in the first place.  People have had seeds stolen
mysteriously, and even been targeted for physical attacks and
kidnapping.  While it’s possible to use the strategies below to
protect your bitcoin in these circumstances, it’s much better not
to have to rely on them!  However it <i>is</i> worth considering who
in your family or whatever needs to know how to access your bitcoin
if something happened to you.</p>
<h2 class="western">Simple paper storage</h2>
<p class="western">The most basic level of security is to copy down
your seed words on a bit of paper, and put it somewhere safe.  Use
pen that won’t run.  Maybe put it in a polythene sleeve or bag.</p>
<h2 class="western">Additional copies</h2>
<p class="western">An obvious way to mitigate the risk of loss is to
make multiple copies of your seed, kept in different locations. 
However this will likely increase the risk of theft - so you'd want
each location to be very secure.</p>
<h2 class="western">Multiple wallets</h2>
<p class="western">One way to mitigate lots of risks is to put your
eggs in more than one basket and simply use multiple wallets –
ideally using somewhat different approaches, or storing things in
different places.  This means that if something bad happens, or you
have a brain fart and screw something up, the amount of damage you
can do is limited to the fraction of funds you have in the wallet(s)
affected.</p>
<h2 class="western">Durable storage media</h2>
<p class="western">Paper is obviously susceptible to fire and flood,
so some people like to record their seed words on something more
durable, particularly metal.  Home-made solutions are obviously
possible involving steel plates and punches, but kits specifically
designed for the purpose are also available.</p>
<p class="western">Note that the list of words from which your seed
is made is deliberately designed so each word is uniquely defined by
its first 4 letters. So if GRUEL is in the word list, it means there
are no other words beginning grue (and gruesome will NOT be in the
list). That means you only need to record the first 4 letters of each
word, which can reduce the difficulty of this approach a lot.</p>
<p class="western">Some good info and reviews of available products
<a href="https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Splitting seeds</h2>
<p class="western">Storing a set of seed words always carries the
risk that someone could find it and empty the wallet they are
associated with.  One possible approach to reducing this threat is to
split seeds up into multiple parts for storage in different
locations.</p>
<p class="western">If doing this it’s important to be aware that if
an attacker knows, say, 8 of the 12 words they will probably be able
to “brute force” the other 4 – just by trying all possible
combinations of words.  It’s possible they could do this for 6
missing words.  It’s pretty unlikely, in my view they could do it
with 8.  Problems of brute-forcing partial seeds are less severe if
you are using a wallet with a 24 word seed.</p>
<p class="western">Also you need to be sure that you don’t just
create additional vulnerabilities – for example if you just split
your seed into 3 parts, loss of any part will mean you lose access to
the wallet (unless you can brute force it!).  Overlapping partial
seeds are another possibility.</p>
<p class="western">If using any of these approaches you need to be
sure you can remember what you’ve done, what’s stored where etc.</p>
<h2 class="western">Added passphrase</h2>
<p class="western">This is probably the most effective additional
security you can use – and recommended for large amounts of
bitcoin.  However it entails an additional layer of complexity, and
is not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p class="western">The system for generating a wallet based on 12 or
24 seed words described above also permits you to add further
characters of your own choice – up to 50 in most wallet
applications.  If you do this, the wallet created will be entirely
different, with a completely separate set of addresses and private
keys.  
</p>
<p class="western">An additional “passphrase” such as this is not
usually stored on your wallet application or device.  You will
usually enter it yourself each time you open the wallet.  A hardware
wallet with a given seed can therefore be used as the base for an
unlimited number of different wallets – each defined by a different
passphrase.  
</p>
<p class="western">The big advantage of this approach is that, to
steal your bitcoin, any attacker needs your seed words AND your
passphrase.  Either alone is useless – as long as the passphrase is
long enough that it cannot be guessed.</p>
<p class="western">It therefore allows strategies where you can split
the information required to recover your wallet – so that an
attacker who finds one part cannot do anything.  It also means that
even if an attacker was able to extract the seed words from your
device somehow (very unlikely but not inconceivable), they would not
be able to access any wallets protected by a passphrase.</p>
<p class="western">If using a passphrase it’s important to be clear
exactly what your strategy is.</p>
<p class="western">For example in a high security strategy the
passphrase should be kept separate from the seed words - but then you
need to be certain that you will be able to recover them both
yourself.  
</p>
<p class="western">Depending on your strategy you probably also need
to be confident that the passphrase is genuinely random, and long
enough that an attacker could not “brute force” guess it.  
</p>
<p class="western">There’s a good explanation of passphrases (as
used on the Trezor) <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/passphrase-the-ultimate-protection-for-your-accounts-3a311990925b">here</a>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Memorization</h2>
<p class="western">The “mnemonic” seed word system was partly
designed to enable relatively easy memorization of seeds.  It’s
probably not a good idea to rely on this alone, but it can be a handy
back-up, as well as allowing you to potentially cross hostile borders
carrying $billions just in your head.</p>
<p class="western">Be aware that memorizing your seed may leave you
vulnerable to the classic <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench
attack.</a></p>
<h2 class="western">Safety deposit boxes</h2>
<p class="western">These can be a good option for storing copies of
seeds.  Used in combination with passphrases they can result in very
secure strategies.  
</p>
<p class="western">Safety deposit facilities will usually only allow
registered users to enter alone – so they give good protection
against physical coercion.  They also can be useful for inheritance
planning as they will have well-defined procedures for giving access
to executors of your estate, usually on production of a death
certificate or similar proof.</p>
<h2 class="western">Multi-signature wallets</h2>
<p class="western">Bitcoin allows you to create wallets where
transactions require combinations of independent signatures to be
valid.  For example you can specify, in effect 3 different seeds, of
which 2 signatures are required.</p>
<p class="western">This functionality is still for advanced users –
and while it’s potentially extremely secure, if you are competent
to use it then you probably aren’t using this guide.</p>
<h2 class="western">Wiping your hardware device</h2>
<p class="western">Every now and then an esoteric vulnerability is
found in a hardware wallet (<a href="http://johoe.mooo.com/trezor-power-analysis/">example</a>).
 They usually involve extracting the seed stored in the device.  
</p>
<p class="western">As described above, such attacks can usually be
prevented by adding a passphrase to your seed words.  But a simpler
solution if you do not regularly use your device for transactions
would simply be to wipe it – and rely on restoring it from seed
when you need it.</p>
<p class="western">Obviously this means you need to be absolutely
confident of your seed storage.  Arguably you should be anyway, but
you can look at the device as a backup of the seed words themselves. 
So an alternative approach might simply be to hide it very well.</p>
