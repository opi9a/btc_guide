To Bitcoin</b></font></font></p>
<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p class="western">This guide is aimed at people taking their first
steps in managing bitcoin in a wallet that they control themselves.
It is a general explanation of relevant aspects of how bitcoiGn works
that applies to all wallets – including hardware devices such as
Trezor and Coldcard, as well as software-only wallets such as
Electrum, Samourai, Mycelium or GreenWallet. 
</p>
<p class="western">Different wallets may have their own ways of doing
things in the user interface – for example using PINs to unlock
devices. But under the hood they will all be doing pretty much what
is described here.</p>
<p class="western"><b>It is important to recognize that in taking
this step, you are personally responsible for anything that happens.
If you make a mistake there is ultimately no recourse or compensation
– you can lose all your funds and plenty have.</b></p>
<p class="western">That’s a good reason to take things cautiously.
Read and consider this guide. Look for other information on the
internet – but always be sceptical, there are many scammers out
there. Decide on an approach you’re happy with before you jump in
and move your coins. You can also use small test amounts of bitcoin
to begin with. Only proceed when you are confident.</p>
<p class="western">But the good news is, with a little consideration
and learning everyone can take full responsibility and control over
their own wealth. That’s why we bitcoin!!</p>
<p class="western">This guide aims to explain:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p class="hanging-indent">BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS: how your wallet
	allows you to receive and send bitcoins, so you can have more
	confidence in using it – and how to actually make transactions</p>
	<li><p class="hanging-indent">SEED WORDS: how you can make and
	securely store backups of your wallet using the all-important seed
	words, so that you are not at risk of losing bitcoin</p>
</ol>

</p>
<p class="western"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western">1. BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS</h1>
<p class="western">The bitcoin system consists of a public ledger or
database of transactions. This ledger is known as the &quot;blockchain&quot;
because transactions are grouped into blocks when they are validated
and added to it. You can see the bitcoin blockchain for yourself on a
“block explorer” like <a href="https://www.smartbit.com.au/">this</a>.</p>
<p class="western">Bitcoins exist as amounts sent in transactions. 
</p>
<p class="western">For example, every new block that is added to the
blockchain creates new bitcoins (currently 6.25), and it does this
with a transaction sending 6.25 btc (from nowhere!) to whoever
created the block. The recipient of that transaction now owns those
6.25 bitcoin.</p>
<p class="western">Subsequent transactions refer back to previous
transactions. For example if the recipient of the 6.25 bitcoin above
w&shy;anted to send 3 bitcoin to someone else, their wallet would
make a new transaction referring to the one in which they received
the 6.25 bitcoin.</p>
<p class="western">So <u>owning bitcoin means being a recipient of
bitcoin transactions</u>. The next section explains how your wallet
allows you to receive transactions by generating “addresses” to
which bitcoin can be sent.</p>
<p class="western">And <u>spending bitcoin means creating bitcoin
transactions that are sent to someone else</u>. As explained below,
your wallet does this too, by using “private keys” to digitally
sign outbound transactions.</p>
<h1 class="western">Addresses define the recipients of transactions</h1>
<p class="western">A transaction needs something to define where (or
who) it's going to. Just like a cheque needs a recipient name, or a
bank transfer needs a destination account. In bitcoin this is defined
by an &quot;address&quot; - a long-ish string of letters and digits
(which actually just represent a very large number). 
</p>
<p class="western">An example of a bitcoin address is:</p>
<blockquote><font face="DejaVu Sans Mono, monospace">3QjKms5ox5Df6poH7s1bBzrVKaMkvoHyGV</font></blockquote>
<p class="western">All bitcoin transactions have a receiving address.
Your wallet software will allow you to generate receiving addresses
like the one above that you can give to people who are sending you
bitcoin. 
</p>
<p class="western">For example, when withdrawing from an exchange you
will probably paste an address from your wallet into the exchange's
web page or app. Bitcoin sent to that address will show up in your
wallet.</p>
<p class="western">Similar to a bank account number, the address
defines who owns the bitcoin, but you need more than just the number
to control the funds. Unlike a bank account number, you normally use
a different address for each transaction you receive.</p>
<p class="western">One of the main ways bitcoin has been stolen from
people is with malware which <font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">compromises</font>
your clipboard when pasting addresses – so that you end up sending
bitcoin to the hacker. So it is extremely important to <b>always
double check all addresses that you use</b><span style="font-weight: normal">.
Hardware wallets will allow you to do this on the device itself, so
you can be sure that no malware is interfering.</span></p>
<h1 class="western">Private keys are used to sign transactions and
send bitcoin</h1>
<p class="western">When bitcoin is moved in a transaction, there
needs to be some way of verifying that this is the intention of the
owner. Otherwise everyone could steal everyone else's bitcoin by just
making transactions sending it to themselves.</p>
<p class="western">Bitcoin transactions are verified by a <u>digital
signature</u>. This is similar to the signature on a cheque, or a
password on a banking app - but a bit more complicated because you
can't just add your signature or password to each bitcoin
transaction. All bitcoin transactions are public, and its important
that they can be validated by everybody - so a simple signature or
password would just be copied and used to steal all the rest of your
bitcoin.</p>
<p class="western">Instead a system is used where each receiving
address is associated with a secret &quot;private key&quot; which can
be used to generate a unique digital signature when a transaction is
made using bitcoin from that address. 
</p>
<p class="western">Everyone can check the signature is valid, and
could only be generated using the private key associated with the
address - but nobody can actually work out what the private key is,
or use the signature to do anything malicious. This cryptomagic is
used for basically all internet security – it’s known as “public
key cryptography”.</p>
<p class="western"><u>Private keys are very sensitive</u>. If anyone
has access to the private key associated with an address in your
wallet then they can steal any bitcoin associated with that address.</p>
<p class="western">Hardware wallets like Trezor are designed to
generate and store private keys and use them to sign transactions in
a very secure way. You will never normally see a private key (though
they are also just large numbers represented by letters and digits).</p>
<h1 class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="6" style="font-size: 24pt"><b>Actually
making transactions</b></font></font></h1>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">As discussed
above, bitcoin is all about transactions.  If you want to spend
bitcoin, say to buy a Tesla, you will have to make a transaction
sending bitcoin.  If you want to receive bitcoin, eg from an exchange
where you have bought it, the exchange will make a transaction to
your wallet.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">This section
covers the basics of how to do that, and identifies two things to be
aware of:  checking the addresses, and choosing the fee levels.</font></p>
<h2 class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Transaction
basics</b></font></font></h2>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">This is what
you need to know whether you are sending or receiving a transaction:</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">1. Begin the
transaction in the SENDING wallet</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">there
	will usually be a “send” button</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">it’s
	going to ask for an amount, and a receiving address</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">you will
	also likely have to choose a fee, or fee rate</font></p>
</ul>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">2. Get an
address from the RECEIVING wallet</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">there
	will usually be a “receive” button</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">the
	address will be in a form similar to above, i.e. a string of letters
	and numbers (should begin 3.. or bc1..)</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">it might
	also be presented as a QR code</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">it is
	normal to use a new address for each transaction</font></p>
</ul>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">3. Enter the
receiving address in the draft transaction on the SENDING wallet</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">you can
	send the address by text or email and copy / paste it into the
	transaction</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">if the
	sending wallet is on a phone you should also be able to scan in the
	QR code from the receiving wallet.</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">(There
	is no security risk if anyone sees this address – it is going to
	be made public on the blockchain anyway – but you might want to do
	it in a way that keeps the address private, so no third parties can
	track what you are doing.  Encrypted messaging like Signal is good
	for this (but not Whatsapp unless you are sure both parties are
	using it correctly).</font></p>
</ul>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">4. Finalise
the transaction in the SENDING wallet</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">make
	sure the amount is OK</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">choose a
	fee – see below</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">check
	the address – see below</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">press
	send</font></p>
</ul>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">5. Check for confirmation of the
transaction</font></p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">the
	receiving wallet should acknowledge the transaction pretty much
	immediately, probably labelled as ‘pending’, or ‘unconfirmed’</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">the
	transaction isn’t finalized until it is included in a block, and
	added to the blockchain</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">you can
	monitor inclusion in a block on either wallet (both of which will
	have a record of the transaction), or </font><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">by
	searching for it in</font><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"> a
	</font><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.blockstream.info/">block
	explorer</a>, using the receiving address or transaction ID (be
	aware this will have a privacy implication, as eg your ISP will see
	what you are looking at).</font></p>
	<li><p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">Blocks
	are made on average every 10 mins but if the transaction has a low
	fee it might take a while to be included in a block.  See the
	section below on fees.</font></p>
</ul>
<h2 class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Double-check
addresses</b></font></font></h2>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">I would guess
that &gt;99% of all bitcoin thefts are caused by either failing to
secure seed words (see below) or interfering with addresses when
sending transactions.  So if you cover these two things you are doing
pretty well.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">Bitcoin
addresses have a clever mechanism to ensure it’s very unlikely you
would send to an address by a mistake due to a typo.  Its called a
“checksum”.  Basically the last few digits of the address are a
fingerprint derived from the rest of the address.  All wallets will
calculate this fingerprint themselves and check it matches with the
one in the address – and reject it if it doesn’t.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">There’s a
good explanation </font><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/checksum">here</a>.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">So the main
threat you are facing is if a bad actor manages to insert their
address instead of the one you want to send to.  If they succeed, the
payment goes to them and you are SOL.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">They can do
this with things like clipboard hijackers.  These monitor the system
clipboard (what you copy into and paste from) for things that look
like bitcoin addresses – and swap them.  Bad browser plugins can
also do this kind of thing in a way that is harder to detect.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">So it’s
obviously important to review the final transaction before sending,
to make sure nothing like this has happened.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">Hardware
wallets will usually have a nice feature to make this kind of attack
pretty much impossible:  they will actually show you the destination
address on the device itself, which is where the transaction is
actually made and signed.  That means even if there is malware on the
host computer it doesn’t matter.</font></p>
<h2 class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>Choosing
fees</b></font></font></h2>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">To be
finalized, bitcoin transactions must be included in a block which is
added to the blockchain.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">Blocks are
made by miners, who listen for new transactions, check they are
valid,  put them in a draft new block and race each other to find a
“solution” fro that block.  If successful they broadcast the new
block to the network and nodes add it to the blockchain.  The process
then begins again with miners competing to add the next block.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">The size of a
block is limited. Its a little complicated but to simplify, each
block can be a maximum of 2Mb in size – so it is a limit to the
amount of information / memory / storage the block takes.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">There are
usually more transactions being made than space in the blocks, so
miners are able to choose which transactions they include.  They do
this on the basis of the <b>fees</b> each transaction pays.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">Transactions
are of variable size, so what miners care about is how much fees a
transaction pays per unit of size.  The normal way to express this is
as <i>sats per byte</i><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><span style="font-style: normal">The
size of a</span><span style="font-style: normal"> </span><span style="font-style: normal">normal
transaction might be 200 bytes.  A typical fee rate right now might
be 10 sats/byte – which would mean you end up paying 2,000 sats.</span></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">Your wallet
software will probably give you some options for setting fees, often
in terms of the priority (‘high’, ‘low’, ‘economy’ etc)
and possibly with an estimate of how long it will take to be
confirmed.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">If you are
happy with the suggested fee then its usually fine to take it at face
value.  But if it seems excessive, or if you don’t want to part
with any more sats than you have to – or if you are just interested
in working this stuff out – then you might want to set a custom fee
that suits you.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><a href="https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,1w,weight">This</a>
is a good resource for checking fee levels and getting an
understanding of how the system works so you can pick the right fee. 
It’s worth taking a while to work out what’s going on with the
chart, but basically it shows the <i>backlog</i> of transactions
waiting to be included, presented according to the fee level they are
paying.  If you look closely you can see that every 10 mins or so the
chart dips downward.  This corresponds to a block being mined, and 2
Mb worth of transactions being removed from the backlog.  As you’d
expect it is the highest fee rate transactions that get removed.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">One risk of
trying to minimize transaction fees is that your transaction gets
“stuck”.  I won’t go into details here of how to deal with
that, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jkw0l5/transaction_stuck_read_this/">this</a>
is an excellent resource to help you.  Bottom line is not to panic –
you cannot lose your bitcoin this way, as the worst case it the
transaction is never included and the bitcoin don’t move.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">A last thing
to say about this:  if you are optimising fees its a good idea to
make sure the “bump fee” or “replace by fee” option is
enabled when you broadcast the transaction.  That gives you a way to
increase the fee later if you need to.</font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">Finally when
setting your own fee, it is conceivably possible, in some wallets, to
get the fee and the amount mixed up.  So you send what you thought
was the fee, and pay what you thought was the amount to miners.  With
modern software I expect you’d have to try pretty hard to do this –
but it’s worth being aware of you don’t end up in <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-user-loses-215000-by-mistake-due-transaction-fee-error-1629451">this
situation</a>.</font></p>
<h1 class="western">2. <font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif"><font size="6" style="font-size: 24pt"><b>SEED
WORDS</b></font></font></h1>
<p class="western">Hodling bitcoin safely ultimatey means looking
after your “seed words” – a set of 12 or 24 words (perhaps with
an additional passphrase) which your wallet will generate for you
when you set it up.</p>
<p class="western">This section explains what seed words are and why
they are important, and discusses things you can do to look after
yours safely.</p>
<h1 class="western">Seed words really <i>are</i><span style="font-style: normal">
your wallet</span></h1>
<p class="western">The first section explained transactions – and
how owning bitcoin means receiving transactions to addresses in your
wallet.</p>
<p class="western">If your wallet has received 5 transactions, this
means that each of 5 addresses in the wallet will be associated with
some quantity of bitcoin - and there will be 5 corresponding private
keys, one for each. 
</p>
<p class="western">In the early days of bitcoin this was all you got.
A wallet had potentially very long lists of addresses and private
keys, and that's all there was to it. 
</p>
<p class="western">There's nothing wrong with this in principle, but
it leads to some practical difficulties which actually pose big
security problems. For example if you want to make a back-up of your
wallet (in case the computer it's stored on breaks) then you have to
copy the whole thing - all the addresses and private keys. You can
only really do this with a computer - as there is so much
information, and a single error could be catastrophic.</p>
<p class="western">This is bad because computers can be compromised,
particularly if they connect to the internet. It would be much better
to be able to make dumb physical backups, like on a piece of paper -
which you could be sure no internet hacker could ever get to.</p>
<p class="western">The need for a simple way to back up an entire
wallet led to the invention of the modern system of &quot;seed words&quot;
or &quot;mnemonic seeds&quot;.</p>
<p class="western">In this system, each new wallet begins by
generating a large random number - which can be represented by a
sequence of 12 (in some wallets 24) words. It's easy for the user to
write this sequence of words down, or even memorize it.</p>
<p class="western">Then the wallet uses clever math to generate a
series (essentially infinite) of addresses and corresponding private
keys. These can be used normally, as shown above, to receive and send
bitcoin.</p>
<p class="western">But the important thing is: the way these
addresses and keys are generated from the seed words is completely
reproducible. That means that all you need is the seed words, and you
can always use those to reproduce your whole wallet – all the
addresses and private keys you ever used. 
</p>
<p class="western">Most wallet programs use the same convention for
doing this, and the math used is all published, so a wallet can be
recovered even if the particular software or device you used
originally no longer exists.</p>
<h1 class="western">Storing seed words</h1>
<p class="western">As a user of a hardware wallet - or any wallet
with significant funds - the most important task by far is looking
after your seed words. 
</p>
<p class="western">This guide won't give specific advice on what to
do with your seed words. As you’ll see it's dependent on your
circumstances and preferences - and making these decisions is an
important part of taking control for yourself. But this section
explains some approaches that could be used in building a security
strategy. You can use them in whatever combination you decide – or
do something completely different. All at your own risk, of course!</p>
<p class="western">First it's worth noting that there are two types
of threat to worry about: 
</p>
<p class="bullet-list" style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm">-
the risk of LOSS of your seed words, so that you cannot recover your
funds;</p>
<p class="bullet-list" style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm">-
the risk of THEFT of your seed words, so that someone else recovers
and steals your funds.</p>
<p class="bullet-list" style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.5cm"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western">These threats are usually in opposition, in the
sense that something which reduces risk of loss (such as having
multiple copies) will often increase the risk of theft – and vice
versa. 
</p>
<p class="western">It’s worth taking time to mull all this over,
and not act in a rush. <b>An important</b> <b>general rule is to </b><span style="text-decoration: none"><b>err
on the side of simplicity</b></span><span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">.</span></span>
Of the two threats above, loss of funds because you fuck something up
is much more probable than theft. And do not underestimate how easy
it is to forget what you have done – so either keep it simple or
make sure you have documented your strategy well (and take care to
keep the documentation safe too!).</p>
<p class="western">Finally it’s good security practice not to tell
people unnecessarily how you are storing your bitcoin – or indeed
that you have any in the first place. People have had seeds stolen
mysteriously, and even been targeted for physical attacks and
kidnapping. While it’s possible to use the strategies below to
protect your bitcoin in these circumstances, it’s much better not
to have to rely on them! However it <i>is</i> worth considering who
in your family or whatever needs to know how to access your bitcoin
if something happened to you.</p>
<h2 class="western">Simple paper storage</h2>
<p class="western">The most basic level of security is to copy down
your seed words on a bit of paper, and put it somewhere safe. Use pen
that won’t run. Maybe put it in a polythene sleeve or bag.</p>
<h2 class="western">Additional copies</h2>
<p class="western">An obvious way to mitigate the risk of loss is to
make multiple copies of your seed, kept in different locations.
However this will likely increase the risk of theft - so you'd want
each location to be very secure.</p>
<h2 class="western">Multiple wallets</h2>
<p class="western">One way to mitigate lots of risks is to put your
eggs in more than one basket and simply use multiple wallets –
ideally using somewhat different approaches, or storing things in
different places. This means that if something bad happens, or you
have a brain fart and screw something up, the amount of damage you
can do is limited to the fraction of funds you have in the wallet(s)
affected.</p>
<h2 class="western">Durable storage media</h2>
<p class="western">Paper is obviously susceptible to fire and flood,
so some people like to record their seed words on something more
durable, particularly metal. Home-made solutions are obviously
possible involving steel plates and punches, but kits specifically
designed for the purpose are also available.</p>
<p class="western">Note that the list of words from which your seed
is made is deliberately designed so each word is uniquely defined by
its first 4 letters. So if GRUEL is in the word list, it means there
are no other words beginning grue (and gruesome will NOT be in the
list). That means you only need to record the first 4 letters of each
word, which can reduce the difficulty of this approach a lot.</p>

<h2 class="western">Splitting seeds</h2>
<p class="western">Storing a set of seed words always carries the
risk that someone could find it and empty the wallet they are
associated with. One possible approach to reducing this threat is to
split seeds up into multiple parts for storage in different
locations.</p>
<p class="western">If doing this it’s important to be aware that if
an attacker knows, say, 8 of the 12 words they will probably be able
to “brute force” the other 4 – just by trying all possible
combinations of words. It’s possible they could do this for 6
missing words. It’s pretty unlikely, in my view they could do it
with 8. Problems of brute-forcing partial seeds are less severe if
you are using a wallet with a 24 word seed.</p>
<p class="western">Also you need to be sure that you don’t just
create additional vulnerabilities – for example if you just split
your seed into 3 parts, loss of any part will mean you lose access to
the wallet (unless you can brute force it!). Overlapping partial
seeds are another possibility.</p>
<p class="western">If using any of these approaches you need to be
sure you can remember what you’ve done, what’s stored where etc.</p>
<h2 class="western">Added passphrase</h2>
<p class="western">This is probably the most effective additional
security you can use – and recommended for large amounts of
bitcoin. However it entails an additional layer of complexity, and is
not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p class="western">The system for generating a wallet based on 12 or
24 seed words described above also permits you to add further
characters of your own choice – up to 50 in most wallet
applications. If you do this, the wallet created will be entirely
different, with a completely separate set of addresses and private
keys. 
</p>
<p class="western">An additional “passphrase” such as this is not
usually stored on your wallet application or device. You will usually
enter it yourself each time you open the wallet. A hardware wallet
with a given seed can therefore be used as the base for an unlimited
number of different wallets – each defined by a different
passphrase. 
</p>
<p class="western">The big advantage of this approach is that, to
steal your bitcoin, any attacker needs your seed words AND your
passphrase. Either alone is useless – as long as the passphrase is
long enough that it cannot be guessed.</p>
<p class="western">It therefore allows strategies where you can split
the information required to recover your wallet – so that an
attacker who finds one part cannot do anything. It also means that
even if an attacker was able to extract the seed words from your
device somehow (very unlikely but not inconceivable), they would not
be able to access any wallets protected by a passphrase.</p>
<p class="western">If using a passphrase it’s important to be clear
exactly what your strategy is.</p>
<p class="western">For example in a high security strategy the
passphrase should be kept separate from the seed words - but then you
need to be certain that you will be able to recover them both
yourself. 
</p>
<p class="western">Depending on your strategy you probably also need
to be confident that the passphrase is genuinely random, and long
enough that an attacker could not “brute force” guess it. 
</p>
<p class="western">There’s a good explanation of passphrases (as
used on the Trezor) <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/passphrase-the-ultimate-protection-for-your-accounts-3a311990925b">here</a>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Memorization</h2>
<p class="western">The “mnemonic” seed word system was partly
designed to enable relatively easy memorization of seeds. It’s
probably not a good idea to rely on this alone, but it can be a handy
back-up, as well as allowing you to potentially cross hostile borders
carrying $billions just in your head.</p>
<p class="western">Be aware that memorizing your seed may leave you
vulnerable to the classic <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench
attack.</a></p>
<h2 class="western">Safety deposit boxes</h2>
<p class="western">These can be a good option for storing copies of
seeds. Used in combination with passphrases they can result in very
secure strategies. 
</p>
<p class="western">Safety deposit facilities will usually only allow
registered users to enter alone – so they give good protection
against physical coercion. They also can be useful for inheritance
planning as they will have well-defined procedures for giving access
to executors of your estate, usually on production of a death
certificate or similar proof.</p>
<h2 class="western">Multi-signature wallets</h2>
<p class="western">Bitcoin allows you to create wallets where
transactions require combinations of independent signatures to be
valid. For example you can specify, in effect 3 different seeds, of
which 2 signatures are required.</p>
<p class="western">This functionality is still for advanced users –
and while it’s potentially extremely secure, if you are competent
to use it then you probably aren’t using this guide.</p>
<h2 class="western">Wiping your hardware device</h2>
<p class="western">Every now and then an esoteric vulnerability is
found in a hardware wallet (<a href="http://johoe.mooo.com/trezor-power-analysis/">example</a>).
They usually involve extracting the seed stored in the device. 
</p>
<p class="western">As described above, such attacks can usually be
prevented by adding a passphrase to your seed words. But a simpler
solution if you do not regularly use your device for transactions
would simply be to wipe it – and rely on restoring it from seed
when you need it.</p>
<p class="western">Obviously this means you need to be absolutely
confident of your seed storage. Arguably you should be anyway, but
you can look at the device as a backup of the seed words themselves.
So an alternative approach might simply be to hide it very well.</p>
