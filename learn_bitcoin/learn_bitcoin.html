The whole point of owning and using bitcoin is: <b>you are
responsible</b>.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Bitcoin exists independently of companies, governments or other
institutions.  It cannot be regulated or controlled. This is an
important part of why it's so revolutionary but it also means that if
you do things wrong, there is nobody official to call.  There are no
helplines or compensation schemes and you cannot reverse
transactions.  <font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><span style="font-style: normal">So
it's very important to proceed cautiously, and patiently. </span></font>
Always be sceptical of what anyone tells you.  There are a lot of bad
actors out there - if you google &quot;buy&quot; bitcoin most results
will probably be scams.  You need to satisfy yourself that what you
are doing is right, rather than purely taking someone else's word for
it (including me!). 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Because of the personal responsibility it entails, I think an
important aspect of using or owning bitcoin is to understand it
sufficiently well that you can have confidence in your actions.  That
might sound daunting but it is actually surprisingly easy.  Even
though bitcoin is a complete monetary system (and more) its mechanics
are actually relatively simple - far simpler than a bank account.  I
don't mean that you need to learn the whole thing before you start,
but I do think it's important to approach it with a mind that is open
to understanding what is going on, rather than just following
instructions someone has given you.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">

<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always">1. What is
bitcoin?</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Bitcoin is essentially a list of transactions, known as &quot;the
blockchain&quot;, which is maintained and synced across a network of
hundreds of thousands of computers across the world.  Anyone can send
bitcoin to anyone else simply by adding a valid transaction to this
list.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Suppose I want to send you 0.3 bitcoin - perhaps as payment for a car
you have agreed to sell to me.  I will use an app (aka a “wallet”)
 to generate the appropriate transaction and broadcast it over the
internet to computer on the bitcoin network for addition to the
blockchain.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The components of a transaction are similar to the components of a
cheque (if you are old enough to remember them).  In our example the
transaction will include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	<b>AMOUNT</b>:  how much is being sent - in this case, 0.3 bitcoin. 
	</p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	<b>TO</b>:  a <i>destination address</i> that you have provided<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
	 An address in bitcoin is a string of letters and digits that
	represents a large number.  </font><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">An
	example of an address is:</font></p>
</ul>
<p class="western" align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<font face="monospace"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">bc1qs7rq26rp3zwc63nvq9jctr8eqh</font></font></p>
<p class="western" align="center" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	<b>FROM</b>: a <i>reference to a previous transaction or
	transactions</i> in which 0.3 bitcoin or more was sent to an address
	I control.  This is the source of the bitcoin I will be sending to
	you.. ..which someone else previously sent to me.</p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	<b>SIGNED</b>:  a <i>digital signature</i> which proves that I
	control the relevant address which has the 0.3 bitcoin. 
	</p>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
After I've given it your address and told it how much to send, my app
will automatically compose the transaction and broadcast it. As long
as it's valid, it will be added to the blockchain for all to see. 
You now own the 0.3 bitcoins, because you control the address they
were sent to - only you can make the right digital signature to send
them elsewhere in a subsequent transaction.  You can hand me the car
keys and we are done..</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
That's pretty much it!  The bitcoin blockchain is literally a list of
transactions just like this.  Kind of amazingly, that is actually all
you need.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
It's like if you were playing cards with friends but didn't have
money to hand - so you use a pen and paper to keep a tally.  At the
end of each hand you record who lost lost how much $ or £ to whom. 
The record you write down would be all you needed to tell who had
what.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The main difference is that with bitcoin the record is set up so
anyone in the world can use it - not just friends who trust each
other - because it's essentially impossible to cheat, eg by making a
fake entry, or changing an entry that was made before.  The
impossibility of cheating is an important reason why bitcoin can have
real value, while a piece of paper you and your friends use to keep
score of a card game cannot.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Congratulations, you now understand bitcoin at its most fundamental
level.  It's <b>a list of transactions that can't be corrupted</b>,
nothing more, nothing less.  Everything else you hear about, all the
apparent complication and unfamiliar aspects of bitcoin - things like
blocks, mining, seeds etc - are really just details.  Most of them
are just ways of making the list secure.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Though there is one &quot;detail&quot; which stands out above all
others and is worth mentioning here, because its implications are
significant.  New bitcoins are created according to a fixed schedule.
 About 19 million have been created at the time of writing but <i>there
will never be more than 21 million</i>.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always">2. Why is
bitcoin interesting?</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
I think there are two fundamental characteristics of bitcoin which
mean it is going to change the world forever. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	<b>It is impossible to prevent anyone from sending, receiving or
	owning bitcoin</b> (or at least it's as difficult as it can possibly
	be).  Anyone can broadcast transactions to the bitcoin blockchain. 
	You don't even need internet, you can do this by radio.  Anyone can
	view the blockchain to check if they received a transaction (eg if
	they were being paid in bitcoin for some item or service).  Anyone
	can own bitcoin by holding the &quot;key&quot; required to sign
	transactions from a bitcoin address, and if managed properly bitcoin
	keys cannot be taken from you.  This all means bitcoin cannot be
	controlled or regulated by governments.  I think that means in the
	end it will supercede governments, in many important ways - as it
	allows economic systems to be built that they cannot control.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	<b>Bitcoin is the first asset in human history with fixed supply</b>.
	 The bitcoin protocol ensures only 21m bitcoins will ever be issued
	(and ~19m have been already).  Everything else you can buy or use as
	a savings vehicle - gold, stocks, bonds, tulips - ultimately will
	increase in supply if the price increases, so keeping the price
	anchored to some economic or physical reality.  With bitcoin there
	is no such reality, no such anchor.  It is a pure speculative asset
	- like a &quot;bubble&quot; but with nothing to pop it.  The
	implications of this are huge - not just for the price, but for what
	it may do to the whole global economy if / when everyone cottons on.
		</p>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
These sound pretty simple, but it took me many years of being
interested in bitcoin to properly understand how significant they
are.  I now think it's more likely than not that a new global economy
will be built based on bitcoin - and that, for better or worse, the
economic power in the world will reside with those who own it.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Recent events in which Canadian truckers protesting against vaccine
mandates had their bank accounts frozen, and charitable donations
intended for them were intercepted, show clearly the need for a free
system of monetary transfer.  For example, if you have a trucker's
bitcoin address it is essentially impossible to stop you from sending
bitcoin to them.  There is no central company or bank to pressure to
confiscate funds.  The transaction is encrypted in transit and cannot
be intercepted.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
It is also becoming plain that the major governments of the world
intend to introduce their own digital currencies.  Under these
schemes all accounts would be held directly with the central bank -
which of course is a branch of government.  Every transaction will
not just be fully tracked by government, it will literally be made by
the government on your behalf – and at their discretion.  This
gives them full veto over all economic activity - for example future
lockdowns could be enforced by simply preventing you from spending
outside your local area.  Cash would be abolished and alternative
means of exchange banned.  All balances will be held at the
discretion of the government and could be arbitrarily changed to
implement their policies.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Government will encompass and control the whole economy.  Even if
they were to begin with good intentions it is inconceivable to me
that they could resist pressure from vested interests to abuse and
exploit this power. In this future scenario, which seems to me fairly
certain to arrive fairly soon, any meaningful ambition for freedom
outside this totalitarian control will be dependent on finding
alternative means to conduct economic life.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This is exactly the purpose for which bitcoin was designed, and which
I believe it can fulfil.  It really is the only hope for
civilization, in my opinion.</p>
<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always">3.  How bitcoin
works.</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
In principle you don't need to know any more about bitcoin to
understand its importance, beyond the fact that it is a list of
transactions which can't be corrupted.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
But in practice, before going further I strongly recommend learning
how the system actually works - at least at a level which will allow
you to confidently take responsibility for your actions when using
it.  This section explains all you will ever need to know, I think,
about how bitcoin works. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The best way to approach this is by looking at the actual system -
the transaction list itself - for real, in live action.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
But first there is one practical detail you need to know.  Rather
than being added to the list individually, new transactions are
grouped into a batch, or &quot;block&quot;, which is added to the
list in one go.  That's why the list is known as a &quot;blockchain&quot;.
 As with most aspects of bitcoin, the reason for grouping
transactions in blocks is to do with preventing cheating.  Right now
it's not important to know why, but its a great example of how
everything about bitcoin's design beyond the simple list of
transactions is just a way to stop cheating.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
There are plenty of sites that let you look directly at the
blockchain.  They are all interfaces behind which is a computer,
connected to the bitcoin network, which maintains an active copy of
the blockchain.  One example is <a href="http://www.blockstream.info/" target="_blank">www.blockstream.info</a>.
 It should look something like this:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
<img src="learn_bitcoin_html_8f0be13bececd394.png" name="Image1" align="left" width="537" height="251">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
As you might have expected, its a list of blocks.  Each block has a
number (or &quot;height&quot;) showing its position in the chain, as
well as a date, number of transactions etc (don't worry about
&quot;weight&quot;).</p>
<h2 class="western">What's in a real transaction?</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Clicking on a block will show you more summary info, and then the
list of transactions it contains.  They may look complicated at first
sight - but it's actually almost all just as described above.  Here's
a typical example:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
<img src="learn_bitcoin_html_4948ec61ff316fe8.png" name="Image2" align="left" width="585" height="151" border="0"/>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
At the top is the &quot;transaction ID&quot; (<b>a793...</b>).  This
is a unique identifier for this transaction that can be referred to
later.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Below, and to the left of the arrow, is another transaction ID
(<b>ac34...</b>).  This refers to a previous transaction that <font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><span style="font-style: normal">sent</span></font>
<b>15.0096 BTC</b><span style="font-weight: normal"> </span><span style="font-weight: normal">to
an address (which is not shown)</span>.  This is the source of funds
for the current transaction.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
On the right of the arrow there are two destination addresses, each
receiving a different amount (<b>12</b> and <b>3.0092 BTC</b>).</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This makes sense when you consider that whoever made this transaction
didn't want to send exactly the amount received in the previous one. 
So this transaction splits the incoming amount between two addresses:
one of these will likely be owned by recipient of the transaction. 
The second address is a way for the sender to return the &quot;change&quot;
back to themselves.  We can't tell which is which but it seems likely
that this person wanted to send 12 BTC to someone else, and the
remainder is the change which went back to an address they control.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
So, transactions can have multiple outputs.  If you scroll around
you'll also see transactions with multiple inputs.  Again this makes
sense if someone wants to send more bitcoin than they received in a
single previous transaction.  Eg if they previously received
transactions for 3 and 5 bitcoin, but want to send 7.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
By the way don't worry, you never have to deal with any of this stuff
when using bitcoin - your wallet app will do it all for you!  This is
just to help you see that what is going on in the blockchain makes
sense.</p>

At this point you may have spotted a couple of gaps in the
explanation of this transaction:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	why doesn't the input amount (15.00096) exactly equal the output
	amount (12 + 3.00092)?  What happened to the missing 0.00004 BTC?</p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	if transactions always need bitcoins that come from a previous
	transaction, then where do thebitcoins come from originally?</p>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The answer to these questions lies in the way bitcoin blocks are made
– which is explained in the next section.  This is easily the most
difficult part of bitcoin to understand.  But it’s still not that
hard, and its worth taking a little time to understand.  Don’t
worry if you don’t get it straight away – the explanation will
still be here if you come back to it and it’s never going to
change!</p>
<h2 class="western">Blocks are created by &quot;mining&quot;</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
In the above example where I sent you 0.3 bitcoin my wallet app would
initially compose the transaction, adding the required amounts and
digital signatures etc, and then send it over the internet to a
computer that's connected to the bitcoin network (like the one behind
the website).  That computer will then send it around to the rest of
the network.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
But the transaction is not yet included in the blockchain, and it
can't be regarded as finalized.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
As we saw, transactions are grouped into blocks before being added to
the blockchain.  This process is known as &quot;mining&quot;, for
reasons that will become apparent.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
People who do this (aka “miners”) continuously monitor the
bitcoin network for new transactions, and assemble them in prototype
blocks – lists of transactions with a few bits of additional data -
ready to be added to the blockchain.  But before they can be added
the miner must first perform an important task.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
To be accepted as a valid, the miner must put the block through a
<i>hash function.</i>  Remember, to a computer everything is a number
– zeroes and ones.  A hash function is a mathematical formula which
takes in any data or number and spits out a number that is derived
from it - often referred to as a <i>fingerprint</i>.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Importantly, the fingerprint for any given input appears completely
unrelated to the input number itself - and even the tiniest change in
the input number will give a completely different fingerprint.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">

The hash function used in bitcoin gives a long fingerprint output.

Because the output of the hash function cannot be predicted, the only

So in this made up example the miner needed to make <font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><span style="font-style: normal">1849</span></font>
attempts, slightly changing the input each time, before getting a
hash fingerprint that got under the target.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Things are considerably more difficult in the real bitcoin network:
at the time of writing it takes on average 27,967,152,532,434
attempts to get a fingerprint that meets the target!  Bitcoin miners
use huge warehouses of specialist computers designed specifically for
this single task of repeated hashing.  And the amount of computing
power devoted to this far exceeds the total power of the world's top
500 supercomputers combined.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
When a miner succeeds in getting the fingerprint of a block of
transactions to meet the target, they finalize the block and send it
out to the rest of the network.  Even though it may have taken huge
resources to get a block to meet the target, it is extremely easy for
everyone else on the network to check that it is valid.  So the
computers holding copies of the blockchain all know they can add the
new block - and the transactions within it become finalized. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The target that miners have to reach to make a block - known as the
&quot;difficulty&quot; - is calibrated to ensure that on average a
new block is found every 10 minutes.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If you look at a block, you will see it’s fingerprint, or “hash”
– eg:</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The string of digits and letters is actually a very big number
(represented in base 16) that is the fingerprint, or “hash” of
the block – i.e. the output you get when you put together all the
transactions in a block, plus some extra data just to be able to
change things, and run it through bitcoin’s hash function.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
A random fingerprint will likely have none of those leading zeroes –
they give an indication of just how low the target is.

<h2 class="western">Mining creates new bitcoins</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Why would miners incur the tremendous expense of all this computing
power?  To make money, of course!</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
When a miner succeeds in making a block they are entitled to two
forms of reward.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The first of these is the creation of new bitcoins.  The rules of
bitcoin allow a successful miner to add a transaction for 6.25 BTC to
an address of their choosing.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This special transaction is often referred to as the &quot;coinbase&quot;
transaction (not to be confused with the company of that name).  It
is usually shown as the first transaction in the block:</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
(don't worry about the &quot;OP_RETURN&quot;)</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
So this answers the first of the questions above:  where do bitcoins
originally come from.  They are all created in the mining of new
blocks.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
When bitcoin started, on 3rd January 2009, the addition of each block
resulted in the creation of 50 new bitcoins. Every 4 years or so
(after a set number of blocks) the amount of new bitcoins created per
block falls by half.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
At the time of writing we have had 3 halvings so each block generates
6.25 new bitcoin.  In a few years that will drop to 3.125 and so on.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This pattern will continue until around the year 2140 when the last
ever fraction of a bitcoin will be mined - and the total in existence
will be 21 million.</p>
<h2 class="western">Miners also collect transaction fees</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
I said the amount of new bitcoin created per block was 6.25, but the
example showed a miner's transaction of 6.37 BTC.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
And we still have to explain why the transaction outputs in our
example were 0.00004 BTC less than the inputs.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The explanation for both these anomalies is <i>transaction fees. 
</i>Each transaction comes with a variable fee, set by the sender,
that appears as the difference between the inputs and outputs.  The
miner is allowed to add all the fees to the transaction they make to
themselves for mining the block.  So in the example transaction
above, the sender chose to add a fee of 0.00004 BTC.  And the example
miner transaction shows that the total of fees across the block was
0.12 BTC.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Its obvious why miners collect these fees.  But why do senders of
transactions voluntarily offer them?  To provide an incentive for the
miner to include their transaction in a block.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
For reasons of security (of course) there is a limit to the number of
transactions that can be included in each block.  (Actually its not a
number limit but a size limit - as transactions can involve varying
amounts of data, for example if they have a large number of inputs or
outputs).  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
For much of bitcoin's history the limit was not relevant because the
amount of transactions being made was a lot less than the quantity
allowed per block.   People would usually add the smallest possible
fee (1 <i>satoshi</i>, which is 1 / 100,000,000 of a bitcoin) to make
sure their transaction was picked up.  But in several recent periods
space in blocks has been a limitation - and it becomes necessary to
pay a higher fee to make sure a transaction gets selected by a miner
for inclusion in a block.  Wallet apps will usually propose the fee
level required, often with different expected times that it will take
for the transaction to be included.  But it's worth being aware of
this aspect of transactions when making your own.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
You can see the queue of new transactions waiting to be included in a
block <a href="https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,weight" target="_blank">here</a>.
 Transactions are ordered by the amount of fee they are offering
given their size (the site refers to &quot;weight&quot; but this
effectively means size). Its worth having a look at this site to see
if you can understand it - as it provides a useful insight into the
working of the system.  For example, can you work out why the graph
has a saw-toothed shape?

<h2 class="western">The requirement to use energy to mine blocks is
the key to bitcoin's security</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The process of mining, with its mind-boggling number of repeated
pointless calculations, may seem gratuitously laborious and
energy-intensive.  And that's deliberate.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
It means that anyone who wants to create a valid block has no
alternative but to go through the same process, and incur the same
costs.  When a user sees a block has been incorporated, they know it
is, in effect, backed by the energy required to generate it.  This
requirement is known as <i>proof of work</i>, and it is fundamental
to bitcoin's security and existence.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
To see <font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><span style="font-style: normal">why</span></font>,
suppose a bad actor decides they want to cheat and rewrite history -
for example to erase a payment they made to someone else.  They will
need to remake a new block, but with the relevant transaction
deleted.  <font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><span style="font-style: normal">However</span></font>
recall that even the tiniest change to the input to the hash function
will completely change the result - so the attacker will have to redo
all that work to get a new solution that meets the target.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
What's worse for the attacker, <i>the fingerprint of each block is
included in the next one</i> – <font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><span style="font-style: normal">so
that will </span></font>also have to be remade, along with any others
that have subsequently been added.  Meanwhile the rest of the bitcoin
system is still adding a block every 10 minutes - all of which must
themselves be remade if the attack is to succeed.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The result of all this is that anyone who wants to cheat needs to
have a significantly more computing power than <font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><span style="font-style: normal">everyone
else</span></font> put together.  Not only would this incur
tremendous cost (and, in practice, an enormous <font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><span style="font-style: normal">secret</span></font>
chip manufacturing programme!), but that amount of power would make
far more by mining honestly than by cheating.</p>

about transactions!  So to start using bitcoin we need a way to
receive and send bitcoin transactions.  That means using a wallet app
- a piece of software which:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	Generates <i>addresses</i> that allow you to receive bitcoin</p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	Stores the credentials that control those addresses (aka <i>private
	keys</i>)</p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
	Generates and broadcasts new transactions when you want to send
	bitcoin - including the all-important <i>digital signature</i> that
	proves you control the addresses associated with the bitcoin you are
	sending</p>
</ul>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
There are thousands of wallet apps available.  Many are outright
scams - even on &quot;trusted&quot; platforms like app stores.  So
it's vital you do whatever research is necessary to get confidence
that the wallet you use is legit.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
For trying bitcoin out, making everyday transactions and storing
small amounts a phone wallet is fine.  I currently recommend <i>Simple
Bitcoin Wallet</i> or <i>BlueWallet</i>, both of which are available
on iOS and Android.  If you are using a desktop computer a wallet
<i>Electrum</i> and <i>Sparrow </i>are good - and they let you see a
bit more detail of what is going on.  As we’ll see below, for
storing large amounts of bitcoin a dedicated <i>hardware wallet</i><span style="font-style: normal">
such as Coldcard, Trezor, or Ledger is probably a good idea and these
may come with their own wallet apps.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Make sure you are installing the legit version of the software - it's
not unknown for close fakes to get onto the app stores and steal
funds.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The following instructions are not specific to a particular wallet. 
But the wallets all do exactly the same thing, so what follows should
apply whatever wallet you have chosen.  NB the wallets themselves
will all come with tutorials etc.</p>
<h2 class="western">What is a bitcoin wallet?</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Before considering how to use your app, it’s worth being clear
about what a wallet is, and explaining what is happening under the
hood.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
A bitcoin wallet is, in effect, a single bitcoin account, with a
particular balance at any time.  So when you initialize a wallet, the
balance is zero.  If you receive 5 BTC, and then send 3.5 BTC the
wallet balance will be 1.5 BTC. Just like a bank account.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Some minor potential for confusion here:  sometimes people will refer
to the wallet app itself (eg <i>Blue Wallet</i><span style="font-style: normal">)
as</span> a wallet.  But really it’s a piece of software that lets
you create and manage bitcoin wallets.  Most wallet apps will let you
create multiple wallets, and you can even open and manage a wallet in
pretty much any wallet app.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
To understand what a wallet does it helps to go through the process
of creating and using a wallet while looking under the hood so see
what is going on.</p>
<h3 class="western">Wallets are defined by their “seed”</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
When a wallet is created it holds a balance of zero.  But that’s
not to say its a completely blank sheet of paper.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
In making a new wallet your app of choice will have created a new and
unique <i>seed</i><span style="font-style: normal">.  It is this seed
which defines your wallet.  As we’ll see the seed alone is all that
is needed to completely recreate every transaction and balance in the
wallet.</span></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
<span style="font-style: normal">The wallet seed is a(nother) long,
random number.  Bitcoin wallet apps will ordinarily never let you
actually see your wallet seed – for reasons that will become
apparent.  But here’s an example of one:</span></p>
<blockquote class="western"><font face="DejaVu Sans Mono, monospace">9cc84682a5f46d47fabd234eb854a2113e9476150ebbc433a1144f3374468eddab0f25c9b740f0cf2ae7182f4a088fe1daf4866c47dead82c127f67de4d6eaf3</font></blockquote>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Again it’s just a number, represented with letters and digits (in
fact it’s normally shown in hexadecimal (base 16) as above, rather
than the decimal form (base 10) we’re used to).</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This seed number is used to derive all the receiving addresses your
wallet will ever use – along with all the corresponding private
keys that provide the credentials for those addresses.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
These are made using a specific formula that takes the seed and spits
out addresses in a fixed order.  A given seed will always spit out
exactly the same sequence of addresses.  Your wallet will work your
way through these as you use it.  Each time you need a new address,
the wallet gets the next one in the sequence.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
For example, here are the first 5 addresses that are generated from
the seed above, along with the corresponding private keys (NB you
should never actually see these when actually using bitcoin, it all
goes on inside your app).</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
So you have your wallet.  The first thing to do is to put some
bitcoin in it – that is to receive some bitcoin in a transaction.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
To receive bitcoin you need an address.  As I said, all the addresses
your wallet will ever use can be created from the seed.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
As this wallet is unused, the first time you make an address you will
get the first address in this sequence.  Alongside the address will
be the corresponding “private key”.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
You can give the address to whoever is sending the transaction to
you.  Once their wallet has made and broadcast the transaction, the
bitcoin they have sent will now be associated with your address –
and you will be able to see it for yourself in the blockchain.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Now if you want to send some bitcoin to someone else, your wallet
will do the same – it will make a transaction, and use the private
key corresponding to the address to make a digital signature and
broadcast it to the bitcoin network.  If there is any change, your
wallet will automatically make another address (and private key) from
your seed, and the change will go to that address.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
To receive a transaction, you create a new receiving address.  This
is what you will give to whoever is sending the transaction to you.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Actually what has happened is that your wallet creates a pair of
large numbers that are related in an important way.  One of these
provides the address which you give out.  The other is the “private
key”.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The private key is the credential that proves you own the address. 
Your wallet will use it to make a digital signature when you want to
send bitcoin from that address.</p>

he first section explained transactions – and how owning bitcoin
means receiving transactions to addresses in your wallet.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If your wallet has received 5 transactions, this means that each of 5
addresses in the wallet will be associated with some quantity of
bitcoin - and there will be 5 corresponding private keys, one for
each. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
In the early days of bitcoin this was all you got. A wallet had
potentially very long lists of addresses and private keys, and that's
all there was to it. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
There's nothing wrong with this in principle, but it leads to some
practical difficulties which actually pose big security problems. For
example if you want to make a back-up of your wallet (in case the
computer it's stored on breaks) then you have to copy the whole thing
- all the addresses and private keys. You can only really do this
with a computer - as there is so much information, and a single error
could be catastrophic.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This is bad because computers can be compromised, particularly if
they connect to the internet. It would be much better to be able to
make dumb physical backups, like on a piece of paper - which you
could be sure no internet hacker could ever get to.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The need for a simple way to back up an entire wallet led to the
invention of the modern system of &quot;seed words&quot; or &quot;mnemonic
seeds&quot;.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
In this system, each new wallet begins by generating a large random
number - which can be represented by a sequence of 12 (in some
wallets 24) words. It's easy for the user to write this sequence of
words down, or even memorize it.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Then the wallet uses clever math to generate a series (essentially
infinite) of addresses and corresponding private keys. These can be
used normally, as shown above, to receive and send bitcoin.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
But the important thing is: the way these addresses and keys are
generated from the seed words is completely reproducible. That means
that all you need is the seed words, and you can always use those to
reproduce your whole wallet – all the addresses and private keys
you ever used. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Most wallet programs use the same convention for doing this, and the
math used is all published, so a wallet can be recovered even if the
particular software or device you used originally no longer exists.</p>

<h2 class="western">Double-check addresses</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
I would guess that &gt;99% of all bitcoin thefts are caused by either
failing to secure seed words (see below) or interfering with
addresses when sending transactions. So if you cover these two things
you are doing pretty well.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Bitcoin addresses have a clever mechanism to ensure it’s very
unlikely you would send to an address by a mistake due to a typo. Its
called a “checksum”. Basically the last few digits of the address
are a fingerprint derived from the rest of the address. All wallets
will calculate this fingerprint themselves and check it matches with
the one in the address – and reject it if it doesn’t.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
There’s a good explanation <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/checksum">here</a>.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
So the main threat you are facing is if a bad actor manages to insert
their address instead of the one you want to send to. If they
succeed, the payment goes to them and you are SOL. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
They can do this with things like clipboard hijackers. These monitor
the system clipboard (what you copy into and paste from) for things
that look like bitcoin addresses – and swap them. Bad browser
plugins can also do this kind of thing in a way that is harder to
detect.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
So it’s obviously important to review the final transaction before
sending, to make sure nothing like this has happened. If you are
feeling paranoid (which is good) then check the whole thing. But it’s
worth knowing that addresses are created by an essentially random
process and cannot be made to order. (Eg it is very hard to make
“vanity addresses” with even a few digits that you want: see
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/ab539e614a8497099458ddc6d29275fe0f74db78/ch04.asciidoc#vanity-addresses">this</a>).
That means a fake address is almost certainly going to be completely
different to the real one, so you may be happy only checking a
section or two of the address.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Hardware wallets will usually have a nice feature to make this kind
of attack pretty much impossible: they will actually show you the
destination address on the device itself, which is where the
transaction is actually made and signed. That means even if there is
malware on the host computer it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Choosing fees</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
To be finalized, bitcoin transactions must be included in a block
which is added to the blockchain.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Blocks are made by miners, who listen for new transactions, check
they are valid, put them in a draft new block and race each other to
find a “solution” fro that block. If successful they broadcast
the new block to the network and nodes add it to the blockchain. The
process then begins again with miners competing to add the next
block.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The size of a block is limited. Its a little complicated but to
simplify, each block can be a maximum of 2Mb in size – so it is a
limit to the amount of information / memory / storage the block
takes.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
There are usually more transactions being made than space in the
blocks, so miners are able to choose which transactions they include.
They do this on the basis of the <b>fees</b> each transaction pays.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Transactions are of variable size, so what miners care about is how
much fees a transaction pays per unit of size. The normal way to
express this is as <i>sats per byte</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">The
size of a</span></span><span style="font-variant: normal"> </span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">normal
transaction might be 200 bytes. A typical fee rate right now might be
10 sats/byte – which would mean you end up paying 2,000 sats.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Your wallet software will probably give you some options for setting
fees, often in terms of the priority (‘high’, ‘low’,
‘economy’ etc) and possibly with an estimate of how long it will
take to be confirmed.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If you are happy with the suggested fee then its usually fine to take
it at face value. But if it seems excessive, or if you don’t want
to part with any more sats than you have to – or if you are just
interested in working this stuff out – then you might want to set a
custom fee that suits you.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
<font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><a href="https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,1w,weight">This</a>
is a good resource for checking fee levels and getting an
understanding of how the system works so you can pick the right fee.
It’s worth taking a while to work out what’s going on with the
chart, but basically it shows the </font><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><i>backlog</i></font><font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif">
of transactions waiting to be included, presented according to the
fee level they are paying. If you look closely you can see that every
10 mins or so the chart dips downward. This corresponds to a block
being mined, and 2 Mb worth of transactions being removed from the
backlog. As you’d expect it is the highest fee rate transactions
that get removed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
One risk of trying to minimize transaction fees is that your
transaction gets “stuck”. I won’t go into details here of how
to deal with that, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jkw0l5/transaction_stuck_read_this/">this</a>
is an excellent resource to help you. Bottom line is not to panic –
you cannot lose your bitcoin this way, as the worst case it the
transaction is never included and the bitcoin don’t move.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
A last thing to say about this: if you are optimising fees its a good
idea to make sure the “bump fee” or “replace by fee” option
is enabled when you broadcast the transaction. That gives you a way
to increase the fee later if you need to.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Finally when setting your own fee, it is conceivably possible, in
some wallets, to get the fee and the amount mixed up. So you send
what you thought was the fee, and pay what you thought was the amount
to miners. With modern software I expect you’d have to try pretty
hard to do this – but it’s worth being aware of you don’t end
up in <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-user-loses-215000-by-mistake-due-transaction-fee-error-1629451">this

bitcoin</h1>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If you have decided bitcoin is interesting, and maybe you think it
could be a good way to store some of your wealth - or if you just
want to play around with it - the next step is probably to get some. 
You might be able to get a friend to send you some small amounts to
play with (see later).  But this section explains what to do if you
decide to buy a non-trivial amount.  Be very careful before you do
anything that risks a significant amount of money!</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
You will probably want to buy bitcoin from an <b>exchange</b> - a
company which brings together buyers and sellers, like a stock
exchange. Some recommended exchanges in the UK are <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/places/united-kingdom" target="_blank">coinbase</a>,
<a href="https://coinfloor.co.uk/hodl/" target="_blank">coinfloor</a>,
<a href="https://www.coincorner.com/" target="_blank">coincorner</a>
and <a href="http://www.kraken.com/" target="_blank">kraken</a>. 
Most of these appear like banking apps, with the trading going on
under the hood, but I think kraken is more explicitly an exchange. 
Recent feedback I had (Jan 2021) was that kraken was the best of
these.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
For all these companies you will be required to provide ID and KYC
information in order to register - and doing this can be a hassle, as
well as compromising your privacy.  You should assume that govenments
will have records of all your transactions with these companies. 
There are steps you can take subsequently to improve your privacy
somewhat, but you can't avoid your initial acquisition from being
known - and for your ID and personal information being entrusted to
these third parties.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If that's something you are concerned about there are other
alternatives which allow <b>peer to peer trading</b>.  I have
previously used a service called <a href="https://bittylicious.com/" target="_blank">bittylicious</a>,
which pairs you with people who want to sell bitcoin and you make the
transaction by bank transfer.  The KYC requirements there are a lot
less.  It will show up in your bank account as a transfer to a
(random) individual - which may be good if that individual is not
labelled in anyone's system as a bitcoin seller.  However it is
possible that your bank might regard too much of this activity as
being suspicious.  (I have not has such problems, but it's definitely
a possibility to consider).</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
A similar service, though with more of an explicit privacy objective
is <a href="https://bisq.network/markets/?currency=btc_gbp" target="_blank">bisq</a>.
 It's actually just a piece of software which acts as a
&quot;decentralized exchange&quot;.  I have never used it but it is
well regarded in the community.  You will probably pay a higher
spread than other approaches.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">

<br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
There are also many <b>bitcoin ATMs</b> in the UK.  You can find them
with a tool like <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/country/225/bitcoin-atm-united-kingdom/" target="_blank">this</a>.
 I have not used these before, and I'm not certain of the level of
KYC required but it is likely to be less than an exchange.  You will
probably pay a lot more in fees using one of these, compared to an
exchange.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Finally the best way to get bitcoin is usually to <b>buy from
friends</b>.  I'm personally not looking to sell any right at this
moment, though I may do later in the year.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">

<h1 class="western" style="page-break-before: always">5. How to take
responsibility for your bitcoin</h1>
<h2 class="western">Why it is important</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
There is a saying in bitcoin:  &quot;<i>not your keys, not your
coins</i>&quot;.  This refers to the fact that unless your coins are
associated with a wallet that you alone control, they do not really
belong to you - because whoever does control them may ultimately do
what they like with them.  If your bitcoin is still on an exchange it
means they own it and you are depending on them to give it to you
when you want it.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The most obvious example of this is exchanges being hacked (or
pretending to), or being subject to fraud, or just plain
disappearing.  The exchanges listed above have good reputations, and
I would not expect this to happen to them in any short to medium term
timescale - but leaving your bitcoin in their possession is simply
not a viable long term strategy for most people, in my view.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
As well as the risk of theft, its important to recognise that these
companies will always have to comply with government instructions. 
Personally I think every bitcoiner should be prepared for the
possibility that bitcoin will be banned - or its ownership or usage
severely restricted in law - at some point.  It is a direct threat to
governments and while I expect them to submit to it eventually, we
should expect they will not cede power without a fight.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
One possible scenario is that governments will attempt to confiscate
bitcoin - and the exchange would be forced to comply and hand yours
over.  Perhaps more likely is that that the govt will put
restrictions on people who want to hold bitcoin in their own wallets
- for example by requiring licences and preventing exchanges from
allowing bitcoin to be withdrawn without a licence.  If you can't
withdraw your bitcoin from the exchange you have lost control over
it, and could not longer be said to really own it.  
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
So if you buy from an exchange, my advice is that you should do so
with the intention of taking ownership of it yourself, as soon as you
feel confident to do so - because then nobody can prevent you from
holding or using it.  That means using your own <i>wallet</i> - a
software app that allows you to hold and transact bitcoin.  There are
many of these, and most operate on computers or phones.  But for any
significant amount of bitcoin I would recommend using a <i>hardware
wallet</i>.</p>
<h3 class="western">Hardware wallets</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This is a physical device that is, by design, extremely difficult to
compromise.  There are 3 or 4 reputable brands but of these one
stands out, in my view, as by far the most secure:  <a href="https://coldcardwallet.com/" target="_blank">coldcard</a>.
 They are a Canadian company, so getting delivery can be a bit of a
pain - but worth it.  Two viable alternatives, which are probably
easier to get hold of, are <a href="https://trezor.io/" target="_blank">trezor</a>
and <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank">ledger</a>.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If you decide to buy any significant quantity of bitcoin I would
advise you to order a hardware wallet as soon as possible.  They can
take a while to deliver.  Currently the price of bitcoin is in a
phase of growth.  In previous such phases things have got quite
crazy, and hardware wallets sell out, so if you have decided to get
one it is best to act now.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If you do buy a hardware wallet there are a few things to bear in
mind.  First always make sure you buy direct from the seller, and not
eg from amazon, or from a spoof site.  If someone tampers with the
device they can steal all your bitcoin.  Second, if you have the
option to send it somewhere other than your home it's probably wise
to do this.  There have been examples of people being targeted
because it was known that someone at their address had bought a
bitcoin wallet.  If you don't have the option it's probably OK, but I
just thought I should mention this possible factor to consider.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
After that comes the hard part - actually setting up your wallet,
using it and protecting it.  For this I have written <a href="https://opi9a.github.io/btc_guide/how_to_bitcoin.html" target="_blank">a
guide</a> that tells you everything you need to know - and also gives
enough explanation of the bitcoin system to understand what you are
doing and why.  It is important to <b>take your time</b> when
managing your bitcoin.  The risk of making a mistake is probably much
greater than the risk of getting hacked, so don't move your bitcoins
until you are confident.</p>
<h2 class="western">Storing seed words</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
As a user of a hardware wallet - or any wallet with significant funds
- the most important task by far is looking after your seed words. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This guide won't give specific advice on what to do with your seed
words. As you’ll see it's dependent on your circumstances and
preferences - and making these decisions is an important part of
taking control for yourself. But this section explains some
approaches that could be used in building a security strategy. You
can use them in whatever combination you decide – or do something
completely different. All at your own risk, of course!</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
First it's worth noting that there are two types of threat to worry
about: 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
- the risk of LOSS of your seed words, so that you cannot recover
your funds;</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
- the risk of THEFT of your seed words, so that someone else recovers
and steals your funds.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
These threats are usually in opposition, in the sense that something
which reduces risk of loss (such as having multiple copies) will
often increase the risk of theft – and vice versa. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
It’s worth taking time to mull all this over, and not act in a
rush. <b>An important</b> <b>general rule is to </b><span style="text-decoration: none"><b>err
on the side of simplicity</b></span><span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">.</span></span>
Of the two threats above, loss of funds because you fuck something up
is much more probable than theft. And do not underestimate how easy
it is to forget what you have done – so either keep it simple or
make sure you have documented your strategy well (and take care to
keep the documentation safe too!).</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Finally it’s good security practice not to tell people
unnecessarily how you are storing your bitcoin – or indeed that you
have any in the first place. People have had seeds stolen
mysteriously, and even been targeted for physical attacks and
kidnapping. While it’s possible to use the strategies below to
protect your bitcoin in these circumstances, it’s much better not
to have to rely on them! However it <i>is</i> worth considering who
in your family or whatever needs to know how to access your bitcoin
if something happened to you.</p>
<h3 class="western">Simple paper storage</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The most basic level of security is to copy down your seed words on a
bit of paper, and put it somewhere safe. Use pen that won’t run.
Maybe put it in a polythene sleeve or bag.</p>
<h3 class="western">Additional copies</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
An obvious way to mitigate the risk of loss is to make multiple
copies of your seed, kept in different locations. However this will
likely increase the risk of theft - so you'd want each location to be
very secure.</p>
<h3 class="western">Multiple wallets</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
One way to mitigate lots of risks is to put your eggs in more than
one basket and simply use multiple wallets – ideally using somewhat
different approaches, or storing things in different places. This
means that if something bad happens, or you have a brain fart and
screw something up, the amount of damage you can do is limited to the
fraction of funds you have in the wallet(s) affected.</p>

Paper is obviously susceptible to fire and flood, so some people like
to record their seed words on something more durable, particularly
metal. Home-made solutions are obviously possible involving steel
plates and punches, but kits specifically designed for the purpose
are also available.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Note that the list of words from which your seed is made is
deliberately designed so each word is uniquely defined by its first 4
letters. So if GRUEL is in the word list, it means there are no other
words beginning grue (and gruesome will NOT be in the list). That
means you only need to record the first 4 letters of each word, which
can reduce the difficulty of this approach a lot.</p>

<h3 class="western">Splitting seeds</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Storing a set of seed words always carries the risk that someone
could find it and empty the wallet they are associated with. One
possible approach to reducing this threat is to split seeds up into
multiple parts for storage in different locations.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If doing this it’s important to be aware that if an attacker knows,
say, 8 of the 12 words they will probably be able to “brute force”
the other 4 – just by trying all possible combinations of words.
It’s possible they could do this for 6 missing words. It’s pretty
unlikely, in my view they could do it with 8. Problems of
brute-forcing partial seeds are less severe if you are using a wallet
with a 24 word seed.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Also you need to be sure that you don’t just create additional
vulnerabilities – for example if you just split your seed into 3
parts, loss of any part will mean you lose access to the wallet
(unless you can brute force it!). Overlapping partial seeds are
another possibility.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If using any of these approaches you need to be sure you can remember
what you’ve done, what’s stored where etc.</p>
<h3 class="western">Added passphrase</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This is probably the most effective additional security you can use –
and recommended for large amounts of bitcoin. However it entails an
additional layer of complexity, and is not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The system for generating a wallet based on 12 or 24 seed words
described above also permits you to add further characters of your
own choice – up to 50 in most wallet applications. If you do this,
the wallet created will be entirely different, with a completely
separate set of addresses and private keys. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
An additional “passphrase” such as this is not usually stored on
your wallet application or device. You will usually enter it yourself
each time you open the wallet. A hardware wallet with a given seed
can therefore be used as the base for an unlimited number of
different wallets – each defined by a different passphrase. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The big advantage of this approach is that, to steal your bitcoin,
any attacker needs your seed words AND your passphrase. Either alone
is useless – as long as the passphrase is long enough that it
cannot be guessed.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
It therefore allows strategies where you can split the information
required to recover your wallet – so that an attacker who finds one
part cannot do anything. It also means that even if an attacker was
able to extract the seed words from your device somehow (very
unlikely but not inconceivable), they would not be able to access any
wallets protected by a passphrase.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
If using a passphrase it’s important to be clear exactly what your
strategy is.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
For example in a high security strategy the passphrase should be kept
separate from the seed words - but then you need to be certain that
you will be able to recover them both yourself. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Depending on your strategy you probably also need to be confident
that the passphrase is genuinely random, and long enough that an
attacker could not “brute force” guess it. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
There’s a good explanation of passphrases (as used on the Trezor)
<a href="https://blog.trezor.io/passphrase-the-ultimate-protection-for-your-accounts-3a311990925b">here</a>.</p>
<h3 class="western">Memorization</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
The “mnemonic” seed word system was partly designed to enable
relatively easy memorization of seeds. It’s probably not a good
idea to rely on this alone, but it can be a handy back-up, as well as
allowing you to potentially cross hostile borders carrying $billions
just in your head.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Be aware that memorizing your seed may leave you vulnerable to the
classic <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench attack.</a></p>
<h3 class="western">Safety deposit boxes</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
These can be a good option for storing copies of seeds. Used in
combination with passphrases they can result in very secure
strategies. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Safety deposit facilities will usually only allow registered users to
enter alone – so they give good protection against physical
coercion. They also can be useful for inheritance planning as they
will have well-defined procedures for giving access to executors of
your estate, usually on production of a death certificate or similar
proof.</p>
<h3 class="western">Multi-signature wallets</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Bitcoin allows you to create wallets where transactions require
combinations of independent signatures to be valid. For example you
can specify, in effect 3 different seeds, of which 2 signatures are
required.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
This functionality is still for advanced users – and while it’s
potentially extremely secure, if you are competent to use it then you
probably aren’t using this guide.</p>
<h2 class="western">Wiping your hardware device</h2>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Every now and then an esoteric vulnerability is found in a hardware
wallet (<a href="http://johoe.mooo.com/trezor-power-analysis/">example</a>).
They usually involve extracting the seed stored in the device. 
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
As described above, such attacks can usually be prevented by adding a
passphrase to your seed words. But a simpler solution if you do not
regularly use your device for transactions would simply be to wipe it
– and rely on restoring it from seed when you need it.</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal; line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
Obviously this means you need to be absolutely confident of your seed
storage. Arguably you should be anyway, but you can look at the
device as a backup of the seed words themselves. So an alternative
approach might simply be to hide it very well.</p>

The better you understand bitcoin, the more confident you will be in
keeping it securely.  But also, for me, bitcoin has probably been the
most interesting new thing I have ever come across, and learning
about it - the system and its economic and social effects - has been
extremely rewarding.</p>

I won't go into too much detail of that here, but this is great

 A lot of it will be in much more detail than you're interested in
now - but with judicious selectivity this should have everything.  I
particularly recommend videos by Andreas Antonopolous who really got
me into this.  The history of bitcoin and its creation is especially
cool, and there's a section for that.</p>

If I was to pick a single resource for explaining how bitcoin

Podcasts are a great way of getting into this stuff.  Theres a list

the quality is a bit variable, and they usually churn out shows
whether there's anything to talk about or not..  If you'd like an
inspiring one to start with, I'd recommend <a href="https://anchor.fm/tales-from-the-crypt/episodes/210-Adam-Curry-emtvfc" target="_blank">this
one</a>, involving the Godfather of Podcasting.  There may be some
technical stuff in it which doesn't make sense yet, but as I recall
it should be a good way to illustrate the possibilities bitcoin
creates for uncensorable communication networks - an important part
of the new, free world which I can see being built on bitcoin.</p>
